## NL Project : Team 5 ##

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can provide answers and give information to an agent that has no prior knowledge of a subject.

### Models ###

We have implemented three different models for the task:

1. BiDAF enhanced with BERT embeddings
2. FlowQA enhanced with prediction of meta information about the question
3. FlowQA enhanced with attention

Instructions to run each model : Please refer to the ReadME files inside each individual folder.
