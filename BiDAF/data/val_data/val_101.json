{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Turner recorded his fifth studio album in Burbank, California, in October 2012. The reason for recording abroad the first time in California was that producer Rich Costey wouldn't come to England with all his equipment so he convinced Turner to record it in Burbank. Frank Turner announced via Twitter on 28 October 2012 that recording was completed, and mixing and mastering would be done in time for a March 2013 release date. During the November and December UK tour a free CD titled Good Hangs from Xtra Mile Recordings was distributed for free at Frank Turner shows, this included a yet-to-be-released Turner song titled \"Tattoos\" plus the Mongol Horde song \"Casual Threats From Weekend Hardmen\". On Christmas Day 2012, the song \"Four Simple Words\" was released on Xtra Mile Recordings' website as a free download along with the b-side \"Cowboy Chords\". On 4 January 2013, a video was shot for what would be the first single. On the same day Frank announced on Twitter that the single was the song \"Recovery\". On 9 January, Frank uploaded a photo to his Instagram page showing the names of all 13 songs that would feature on his new album. This included songs played during the UK and US tours of 2012 such as \"Anymore\", \"Plain Sailing Weather\", \"We Shall Not Overcome\" and \"Tell Tale Signs\". Frank also posted on his fan forum that an extended edition of his new album would be released that includes an extra 5 or 6 songs. On 19 February 2013, it was announced that Turner had signed a licensing deal with Interscope Records in the US for Tape Deck Heart. Following the release of the album Frank Turner embarked on a short UK tour. He has also been confirmed as the headline act for the Two Thousand Trees Festival and main stage slots at the Reading and Leeds festivals. Following the success of the album, Turner embarked on a UK arena tour, including a date at London's O2 arena. On 3 January 2014, Turner appeared on the BBC's Celebrity Mastermind answering questions on Iron Maiden, scoring 20 points in total (7 on his specialist subject), and coming first. In Q2 2014, Turner announced that he was currently in the process of making a sixth studio album. Turner said that it would most likely be out early 2015, although actual dates are uncertain at this time. In 2014 Turner and Mongol Horde released a full-length self-titled studio album, and toured in support of that album in late June, playing a run of smaller venues. In July of that year, Turner also announced a 15 Date UK tour, playing places that wouldn't normally feature live music such as local town halls. On 25 July 2014, Turner announced on his Twitter page that he was collating The Third Three Years. It was released on 24 November 2014.
