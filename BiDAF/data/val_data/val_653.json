{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 1987, Portillo was given his first ministerial post, as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security; the following year, he was promoted to Minister of State for Transport. Portillo has stated that he considers \"saving the Settle to Carlisle railway\" was his greatest achievement. In 1990, Portillo was appointed Minister of State for Local Government, in which post he argued in favour of the ultimately highly unpopular Community Charge system (popularly known as \"the Poll Tax\"). He demonstrated a consistently right-of-centre line (exemplified by his insistence, in a well-publicised speech, of placing \"clear blue water\" between the policies of the Conservatives and other parties) and was favoured by Norman Tebbit and Margaret Thatcher, who said of him \"[W]e expect great things of you, do not disappoint us\". His rise continued under John Major; he was made a Cabinet Minister in 1992 as Chief Secretary to the Treasury and was admitted to the Privy Council the same year. He subsequently became Secretary of State for Employment (1994-95), and then Secretary of State for Defence (1995-1997). As Defence Secretary, Portillo became the object of criticism when he invoked the motto of the SAS, \"Who Dares, Wins\", at a speech at the 1995 Conservative Party annual conference. His high profile led to constant attention from the media, including Private Eye, which mockingly referred to him as \"Portaloo\". He was accused of vanity when the Alexandra Palace was hired to celebrate his ten years in politics. Some saw the Defence Secretary post as a reward for Portillo's cautious loyalty to Major during the 1995 leadership challenge of John Redwood, following Major's \"back me or sack me\" resignation as party leader. Many urged Portillo, the \"darling of the right\", to run against Major. He declined to enter the first round, but planned to challenge Major if the contest went to a second round. To this end, he set up a potential campaign headquarters, with banks of telephone lines. He later admitted that this had been an error: \"I did not want to oppose [Major], but neither did I want to close the possibility of entering a second ballot if it came to that.\" Portillo acknowledged that \"ambiguity is unattractive\" and his opponents within the party later used Portillo's apparent equivocation as an example of his indecisiveness; \"I appeared happy to wound but afraid to strike: a dishonourable position.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What did he do in government?", "answers": [{"text": "In 1987, Portillo was given his first ministerial post, as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security;", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Portillo was given his first ministerial post, as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security;", "answer_start": 9}, {"text": "first ministerial post, as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security;", "answer_start": 32}, {"text": "In 1987, Portillo was given his first ministerial post, as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security;", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "In 1987, Portillo was given his first ministerial post, as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security;", "answer_start": 0}], "id": "C_8dd2eb98ae3c4ecfa08b17b46c66db30_1_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "In 1987, Portillo was given his first ministerial post, as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security;", "answer_start": 0}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?", "answers": [{"text": "His high profile led to constant attention from the media, including Private Eye, which mockingly referred to him as \"Portaloo\".", "answer_start": 1301}, {"text": "the following year, he was promoted to Minister of State for Transport.", "answer_start": 119}, {"text": "Portillo was appointed Minister of State for Local Government, in which post he argued in favour of the ultimately highly unpopular Community Charge system", "answer_start": 308}, {"text": "the following year, he was promoted to Minister of State for Transport.
