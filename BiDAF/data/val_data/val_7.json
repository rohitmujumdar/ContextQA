{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Spector began to reemerge in the late 1970s, producing and co-writing a controversial 1977 album by Leonard Cohen, entitled Death of a Ladies' Man. This angered many devout Cohen fans who preferred his stark acoustic sound to the orchestral and choral wall of sound that the album contains. The recording was fraught with difficulty. After Cohen had laid down practice vocal tracks, Spector mixed the album in studio sessions, rather than allowing Cohen to take a role in the mixing, as Cohen had previously done. Cohen remarked that the end result is \"grotesque\", but also \"semi-virtuous\"--for many years, he included a reworked version of the track \"Memories\" in live concerts. Bob Dylan and Allen Ginsberg also participated in the background vocals on \"Don't Go Home with Your Hard-On\", which is the second time Spector indirectly \"produced\" Dylan--the first being Dylan's live recordings on The Concert for Bangladesh. Spector also produced the much-publicized Ramones album End of the Century in 1979. As with his work with Leonard Cohen, End of the Century received criticism from Ramones fans who were angered over its radio-friendly sound. However, it contains some of the best known and most successful Ramones singles, such as \"Rock 'n' Roll High School\", \"Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio?\" and their cover of a previously released Spector song for the Ronettes, \"Baby, I Love You.\" Guitarist Johnny Ramone later commented on working with Spector on the recording of the album, \"It really worked when he got to a slower song like 'Danny Says'--the production really worked tremendously. For the harder stuff, it didn't work as well.\" Rumors circulated for years that Spector had threatened members of the Ramones with a gun during the sessions. Dee Dee claimed that Spector once pulled a gun on him when he tried to leave a session. Drummer Marky Ramone recalled in 2008, \"They [guns] were there but he had a license to carry. He never held us hostage. We could have left at any time\".
