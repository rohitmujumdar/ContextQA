{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 1975, Prime Minister Bhutto subsequently removed him from the State Bank, instead posting him at the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Khan was appointed Defence Secretary, which was fortuitous in that it brought him into close contact with the Pakistani military establishment. Though an unusual assignment for a financial expert, this appointment made him a powerful bureaucrat in the country. During that time, Khan became closer to General Zia-ul-Haq and had later coveted for General Zia-ul-Haq's appointment as the chief of army staff. As Defence Secretary, he helped manage Pakistan's large but integrated atomic bomb project and had been directly associated with the program. Khan was a vehement support of the program and saw it as a \"national priory\". He backed the advocacy of theorist Dr.Abdul Qadeer Khan and helped establishing the Engineering Research Laboratories in Kahuta. He headed the Uranium Coordination Board (UCB) which consisted of AGN Kazi, Munir Ahmad, and Agha Shahi; he later helped consolidate the efforts at ERL under Lt. Gen. Zahid Ali Akbar as its first military director. After approving the survey by General Akbar, he helped secure the funds for the ERL works and lobbying for General Akbar's promotion as the Engineer-in-Chief. Khan cemented close relations with Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan and Munir Ahmad Khan, and remained Qadeer Khan's staunch loyal. His involvement and support earned him the nickname as \"Mr. Nuke\" by the U.S. diplomats, while the new media dubbed him as \"Baba Atom Bomb \". On the contrary, Ishaq Khan did not have the directorial role in the atomic bomb program until Munir Ahmad Khan retired. After Munir Ahmad Khan took retirement from Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), President Ghulam Ishaq Khan eventually consolidated the entire program under the civic-military control, and supervised the classified projects of the program.
