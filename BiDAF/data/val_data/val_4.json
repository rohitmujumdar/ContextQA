{"paragraphs": [{"context": "During the aftermath of the murder of Stefan Pakeerah, by his friend Warren Leblanc in Leicestershire, England, the game Manhunt was linked after the media wrongfully claimed police found a copy in Leblanc's room. The police officially denied any link, citing drug-related robbery as the motive and revealing that the game had been found in Pakeerah's bedroom, not Leblanc's. Thompson, who had heard of the murder, claimed that he had written to Rockstar after the game was released, warning them that the nature of the game could inspire copycat killings: \"I wrote warning them that somebody was going to copycat the Manhunt game and kill somebody. We have had dozens of killings in the U.S. by children who had played these types of games. This is not an isolated incident. These types of games are basically murder simulators. There are people being killed over here almost on a daily basis.\" Soon thereafter, the Pakeerah family hired Thompson with the aim of suing Sony and Rockstar for PS50 million in a wrongful death claim. Jack Thompson would later vow to permanently ban the game during the release of the sequel Manhunt 2. Thompson said he planned to sue Take-Two/Rockstar in an effort to have both Manhunt 2 and Grand Theft Auto IV banned as \"public nuisances\", saying \"killings have been specifically linked to Take-Two's Manhunt and Grand Theft Auto games. [I have] asked Take-Two and retailers to stop selling Take-Two's 'Mature' murder simulation games to kids. They all refuse. They are about to be told by a court of law that they must adhere to the logic of their own 'Mature' labels. The suits were eradicated when Take-Two petitioned U.S. District Court, SD FL to block the impending lawsuit, on the grounds that video games purchased for private entertainment could not be considered public nuisances. The following day, Thompson wrote on his website \"I have been praying, literally, that Take-Two and its lawyers would do something so stupid, that such a misstep would enable me to destroy Take-Two. The pit Take-Two has dug for itself will be patently clear next week when I strike back.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "How was Jack Thompson's related to Manhunt?", "answers": [{"text": "the game Manhunt was linked after the media wrongfully claimed police found a copy in Leblanc's room.", "answer_start": 112}, {"text": "Jack Thompson would later vow to permanently ban the game during the release of the sequel Manhunt 2.", "answer_start": 1032}, {"text": "claimed that he had written to Rockstar after the game was released, warning them that the nature of the game could inspire copycat killings:", "answer_start": 415}, {"text": "During the aftermath of the murder of Stefan Pakeerah, by his friend Warren Leblanc in Leicestershire, England, the game Manhunt was linked after the media wrongfully claimed", "answer_start": 0}], "id": "C_dabcfc5a414f4daf84acd0717a596d65_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "During the aftermath of the murder of Stefan Pakeerah, by his friend Warren Leblanc in Leicestershire, England, the game Manhunt was linked after the media wrongfully claimed", "answer_start": 0}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What did the media claim?", "answers": [{"text": "found a copy in Leblanc's room.", "answer_start": 182}, {"text": "the media wrongfully claimed police found a copy in Leblanc's room.", "answer_start": 146}, {"text": "the media wrongfully claimed police found a copy in Leblanc's room.", "answer_start": 146}, {"text": "the media wrongfully claimed police found a copy in Leblanc's room.", "answer_start": 146}], "id": "C_dabcfc5a414f4daf84acd0717a596d65_0_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "the media wrongfully claimed police found a copy in Leblanc's room.", "answer_start": 146}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "y", "question": "Was this an honest mistake by the media?", "answers": [{"text": "The police officially denied any link, citing drug-related robbery as the motive and revealing that the game had been found in Pakeerah's bedroom, not Leblanc's.", "answer_start": 214}, {"text": "The police officially denied any link, citing drug-related robbery as the motive and revealing that the game had been found in Pakeerah's bedroom, not Leblanc's.", "answer_start": 214}, {"text": "The police officially denied any link, citing drug-related robbery as the motive", "answer_start": 214}, {"text": "The police officially denied any link, citing drug-related robbery as the motive and revealing that the game had been found in Pakeerah's bedroom,", "answer_start": 214}], "id": "C_dabcfc5a414f4daf84acd0717a596d65_0_q#2", "orig_answer": {"text": "The police officially denied any link, citing drug-related robbery as the motive and revealing that the game had been found in Pakeerah's bedroom,", "answer_start": 214}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What was Jack Thompson's reaction to the matter?", "answers": [{"text": "Jack Thompson would later vow to permanently ban the game during the release of the sequel Manhunt 2.", "answer_start": 1032}, {"text": "Jack Thompson would later vow to permanently ban the game", "answer_start": 1032}, {"text": "Thompson, who had heard of the murder, claimed that he had written to Rockstar after the game was released,", "answer_start": 376}, {"text": "Thompson, who had heard of the murder, claimed that he had written to Rockstar after the game was released, warning them that the nature of the game", "answer_start": 376}], "id": "C_dabcfc5a414f4daf84acd0717a596d65_0_q#3", "orig_answer": {"text": "Thompson, who had heard of the murder, claimed that he had written to Rockstar after the game was released, warning them that the nature of the game", "answer_start": 376}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "Did Rockstar respond?", "answers": [{"text": "\" Soon thereafter, the Pakeerah family hired Thompson with the aim of suing Sony and Rockstar for PS50 million in a wrongful death claim.", "answer_start": 894}, {"text": "The suits were eradicated when Take-Two petitioned U.S. District Court, SD FL to block the impending lawsuit,", "answer_start": 1604}, {"text": "I wrote warning them that somebody was going to copycat the Manhunt game and kill somebody.
