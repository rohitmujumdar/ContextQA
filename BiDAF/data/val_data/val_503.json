{"paragraphs": [{"context": "The film received generally positive reviews. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 72% of critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 7.2/10, based on a sample of 88 reviews. The website's critical consensus states, \"Forrest Gump may be an overly sentimental film with a somewhat problematic message, but its sweetness and charm are usually enough to approximate true depth and grace.\" At the website Metacritic, the film earned a rating of 82 out of 100 based on 20 reviews by mainstream critics. CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade. The story was commended by several critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, \"I've never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter I've never seen a movie quite like 'Forrest Gump.' Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream. The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction...The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths...What a magical movie.\" Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote that the film \"has been very well worked out on all levels, and manages the difficult feat of being an intimate, even delicate tale played with an appealingly light touch against an epic backdrop.\" The film did receive notable pans from several major reviewers. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker called the film \"Warm, wise, and wearisome as hell.\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said that the film \"reduces the tumult of the last few decades to a virtual-reality theme park: a baby-boomer version of Disney's America.\" Critics have compared Gump with various characters and people including Huckleberry Finn, Bill Clinton, and Ronald Reagan. Peter Chomo writes that Gump acts as a \"social mediator and as an agent of redemption in divided times\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Gump \"everything we admire in the American character - honest, brave, and loyal with a heart of gold.\" The New York Times reviewer Janet Maslin called Gump a \"hollow man\" who is \"self-congratulatory in his blissful ignorance, warmly embraced as the embodiment of absolutely nothing.\" Marc Vincenti of Palo Alto Weekly called the character \"a pitiful stooge taking the pie of life in the face, thoughtfully licking his fingers.\" Bruce Kawin and Gerald Mast's textbook on film history notes that Forrest Gump's dimness was a metaphor for glamorized nostalgia in that he represented a blank slate by which the Baby Boomer generation projected their memories of those events. The film is commonly seen as a polarizing one for audiences, with Entertainment Weekly writing in 2004, \"Nearly a decade after it earned gazillions and swept the Oscars, Robert Zemeckis's ode to 20th-century America still represents one of cinema's most clearly drawn lines in the sand. One half of folks see it as an artificial piece of pop melodrama, while everyone else raves that it's sweet as a box of chocolates.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "what was the reception like?", "answers": [{"text": "The film received generally positive reviews.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "The film received generally positive reviews.

The film was directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, and Sally Field. The story depicts several decades in the life of its titular character (Hanks), a slow-witted but kind-hearted, good-natured and athletically prodigious man from Alabama. Gump witnesses, and in some cases influences, some of the defining events of the latter half of the 20th century in the United States, specifically the period between his birth in 1944 and 1982.", "title": "Forrest Gump"}
