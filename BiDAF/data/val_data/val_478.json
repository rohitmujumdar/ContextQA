{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Brownback opposes a single-payer, government-run health-care system. He supports increased health insurance portability, eliminating insurance rejection due to pre-existing medical conditions, a cap on frivolous malpractice lawsuits, the implementation of an electronic medical records system, an emphasis on preventative care, and tax benefits aimed at making health-care insurance more affordable for the uninsured and targeted to promote universal access. He opposes government-funded elective abortions in accordance with the Hyde Amendment. He has been a strong supporter of legislation to establish a national childhood cancer database and an increase in funding for autism research. Brownback supports negotiating bulk discounts on Medicare drug benefits to reduce prices. In 2007, Senators Brownback and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) sponsored an amendment to the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. The amendment created a prize as an incentive for companies to invest in new drugs and vaccines for neglected tropical diseases. It awards a transferable \"Priority Review Voucher\" to any company that obtains approval for a treatment for a neglected tropical disease. This provision adds to the market-based incentives available for the development of new medicines for developing world diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and African sleeping sickness. The prize was initially proposed by Duke University faculty Henry Grabowski, Jeffrey Moe, and David Ridley in their 2006 Health Affairs paper: \"Developing Drugs for Developing Countries.\" Brownback supports a bill that would introduce price transparency to the U.S. health care industry, as well as a bill which would require the disclosure of Medicare payment rate information. On December 16, 2006, Brownback gave an interview to the Christian Post, stating: \"We can get to this goal of eliminating deaths by cancer in ten years.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What are his views on healthcare?", "answers": [{"text": "Brownback opposes a single-payer, government-run health-care system.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Brownback opposes a single-payer, government-run health-care system.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "opposes a single-payer, government-run health-care system.", "answer_start": 10}, {"text": "Brownback opposes a single-payer, government-run health-care system.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Brownback opposes a single-payer, government-run health-care system.", "answer_start": 0}], "id": "C_0a189c86d79e42a5b87402ee6294542d_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "Brownback opposes a single-payer, government-run health-care system.", "answer_start": 0}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "Does he suggest any alternatives to  single-payer government-run healthcare?", "answers": [{"text": "system.
