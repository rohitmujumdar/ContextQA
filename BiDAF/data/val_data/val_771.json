{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Michael Savage calls himself an \"independent-minded individualist\" and says that he \"fits no stereotype.\" He has also cited Barry Goldwater as an influence. Savage criticizes big government as well as liberalism and liberal activism, and accuses the mainstream news media of liberal bias. He considers the three aspects that define a nation as borders, language, and culture; those aspects inspired the motto of the Paul Revere Society. In 2003, Savage said that he voted in 2000 for George W. Bush \"quite reluctantly, incidentally.\" In 2004, Savage and the Revere Society hosted a party at Schroeder's Cafe in San Francisco celebrating the re-election of Bush. Savage donated $5,600 to the campaign of Democratic candidate Jerry Brown in the 2006 California Attorney General election. Regarding candidates for the 2012 Republican primaries, Savage said that Ron Paul had \"great ideas\" but expressed hope that Rick Perry would be the nominee. On December 12, 2011, he offered Newt Gingrich \"1 million dollars\" to withdraw from the United States Presidential contest. He stated that only Mitt Romney had a chance to beat Barack Obama, a man he had previously described as a \"quasi-pseudo-crypto Marxist\" and a possible foreign usurper, in the 2012 election. Savage strongly supported Donald Trump, a regular guest on his talk show, since Trump's June 2015 announcement of his candidacy in the United States 2016 presidential election. Trump has claimed to be a listener and a fan of Savage's show, and an April 2016 Salon article described Savage as having been a major influence on Trump's campaign. Over Christmas of 2017, Michael Savage and his family met several times with President Trump. During a dinner, Savage strongly urged the President to support the cause of wildlife preservation. This followed a series of pleas on his radio show for the President to support legislation that protected wildlife.
