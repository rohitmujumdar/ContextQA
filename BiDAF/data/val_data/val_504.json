{"paragraphs": [{"context": "After the launch of the Superman/Batman comic book series, Executive Editor Dan DiDio had been looking for a way to simplify the Supergirl character from her convoluted post-crisis history; the simplest version of course, was Superman's cousin. Jeph Loeb and editor Eddie Berganza found an opening to reintroduce the character following the conclusion of the first story arc of Superman/Batman. Loeb states: It was the convergence of two trains heading on toward each other. I was working on the Superman monthly when Superman Group Editor Eddie \"Extravaganza\" Berganza and I were kicking around an Armageddon type story where this giant asteroid from Krypton was making its way toward Earth, and somewhere out past Neptune Superman was beginning to feel it. We figured we could tie it into \"The Fall of Luthor\" since DC was very kind to let me both put Lex in the White House and figure out how to get him out. Eddie and I started giggling over the possibilities of there being \"something\" in the asteroid. Or \"someone\" in the asteroid -- neither of us daring to speak her name, but we both knew who [we] were talking about. The modern version of Kara Zor-El made her debut in Superman/Batman #8 (2004). Kara takes the mantle of Supergirl at the conclusion of the storyline. The Supergirl comic book series would later be relaunched, now starring Kara Zor-El as \"The Girl of Steel\". The first arc of the new series was written by Jeph Loeb and illustrated by Ian Churchill. Loeb would later describe the appeal of writing for Supergirl: I love that she has all this power and has to learn what it is to be a superhero in the DCU,\" said Loeb. \"It's one thing to try that with Manhunter (which is terrific), but when you have an icon like Supergirl trying to find her way and, at the same time, at a power level that we haven't even begun to explore ... it should make for a bitchin' good time. As the character continued to be reinvented, steps towards regarding the iconic character were some of the most prominent changes. Artist Jamal Igle and editor Matt Idleson moved to transition the character away from red panties under her skirt to biker shorts, feeling such a change was a logical progression and \"more respectable.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "How was she revived?", "answers": [{"text": "The modern version of Kara Zor-El made her debut in Superman/Batman #8 (2004", "answer_start": 1126}, {"text": "Executive Editor Dan DiDio had been looking for a way to simplify the Supergirl character from her convoluted post-crisis history;", "answer_start": 59}, {"text": "found an opening to reintroduce the character following the conclusion of the first story arc of Superman/Batman.", "answer_start": 281}, {"text": "The modern version of Kara Zor-El made her debut in Superman/Batman #8 (2004).", "answer_start": 1126}, {"text": "Executive Editor Dan DiDio had been looking for a way to simplify the Supergirl character", "answer_start": 59}], "id": "C_5670d06376064e2c91a316143a3d786a_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "Executive Editor Dan DiDio had been looking for a way to simplify the Supergirl character", "answer_start": 59}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "y", "question": "Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?", "answers": [{"text": "Artist Jamal Igle and editor Matt Idleson moved to transition the character away from red panties under her skirt to biker shorts,", "answer_start": 2025}, {"text": "The modern version of Kara Zor-El made her debut in Superman/Batman #8 (2004", "answer_start": 1126}, {"text": "The modern version of Kara Zor-El made her debut in Superman/Batman #8 (2004", "answer_start": 1126}, {"text": "Kara takes the mantle of Supergirl at the conclusion of the storyline.", "answer_start": 1205}, {"text": "The modern version of Kara Zor-El made her debut in Superman/Batman #8", "answer_start": 1126}], "id": "C_5670d06376064e2c91a316143a3d786a_0_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "The modern version of Kara Zor-El made her debut in Superman/Batman #8", "answer_start": 1126}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "When was this released?", "answers": [{"text": "made her debut in Superman/Batman #8 (2004).", "answer_start": 1160}, {"text": "2004", "answer_start": 1198}, {"text": "(2004", "answer_start": 1197}, {"text": "2004", "answer_start": 1198}, {"text": "(2004).", "answer_start": 1197}], "id": "C_5670d06376064e2c91a316143a3d786a_0_q#2", "orig_answer": {"text": "(2004).", "answer_start": 1197}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What was next in the story line?", "answers": [{"text": "The first arc of the new series was written by Jeph Loeb and illustrated by Ian Churchill.
