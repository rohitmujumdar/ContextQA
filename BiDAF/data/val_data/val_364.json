{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 1968, Bowie wrote the lyrics \"Even a Fool Learns to Love\", set to the music of a 1967 French song \"Comme d'habitude\", composed by Claude Francois and Jacques Revaux. Bowie's version was never released, but Paul Anka bought the rights to the original French version and rewrote it into \"My Way\", the song made famous by Frank Sinatra in a 1969 recording on his album of the same name. The success of the Anka version prompted Bowie to write \"Life on Mars?\" as a parody of Sinatra's recording. In notes for iSelect, a compilation that accompanied a June 2008 issue of The Mail on Sunday, Bowie described how he wrote the song: Workspace was a big empty room with a chaise longue; a bargain-price art nouveau screen (\"William Morris,\" so I told anyone who asked); a huge overflowing freestanding ashtray and a grand piano. Little else. I started working it out on the piano and had the whole lyric and melody finished by late afternoon. Bowie noted that Wakeman \"embellished the piano part\" of his original melody and guitarist Mick Ronson \"created one of his first and best string parts\" for the song. The liner notes for Hunky Dory indicate that the song was \"inspired by Frankie\". One reviewer suggested the song was written after \"a brief and painful affair\" with actress Hermione Farthingale. While on tour in 1990, Bowie introduced the song by saying \"You fall in love, you write a love song. This is a love song.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "Where did the song originate?", "answers": [{"text": "The success of the Anka version prompted Bowie to write \"Life on Mars?\" as a parody of Sinatra's recording.", "answer_start": 387}, {"text": "In 1968, Bowie wrote the lyrics \"Even a Fool Learns to Love\", set to the music of a 1967 French song \"Comme d'habitude\",", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "The success of the Anka version prompted Bowie to write \"Life on Mars?\" as a parody of Sinatra's recording.", "answer_start": 387}, {"text": "In 1968, Bowie wrote the lyrics \"Even a Fool Learns to Love\", set to the music of a 1967 French song \"Comme d'habitude\",", "answer_start": 0}], "id": "C_4359ce088f4044ed9dafa0a77532ae7c_1_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "In 1968, Bowie wrote the lyrics \"Even a Fool Learns to Love\", set to the music of a 1967 French song \"Comme d'habitude\",", "answer_start": 0}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What happened next?", "answers": [{"text": "Bowie described how he wrote the song:", "answer_start": 589}, {"text": "composed by Claude Francois and Jacques Revaux.", "answer_start": 121}, {"text": "Bowie's version was never released,", "answer_start": 169}, {"text": "but Paul Anka bought the rights to the original French version and rewrote it into \"My Way\",", "answer_start": 205}], "id": "C_4359ce088f4044ed9dafa0a77532ae7c_1_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "but Paul Anka bought the rights to the original French version and rewrote it into \"My Way\",", "answer_start": 205}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "When was \"My Way\" released?", "answers": [{"text": "1969", "answer_start": 341}, {"text": "1969 recording", "answer_start": 341}, {"text": "1969", "answer_start": 341}, {"text": "the song made famous by Frank Sinatra in a 1969 recording on his album of the same name.", "answer_start": 298}], "id": "C_4359ce088f4044ed9dafa0a77532ae7c_1_q#2", "orig_answer": {"text": "the song made famous by Frank Sinatra in a 1969 recording on his album of the same name.", "answer_start": 298}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?", "answers": [{"text": "While on tour in 1990, Bowie introduced the song by saying \"You fall in love, you write a love song.
