{"paragraphs": [{"context": "After graduating from the University of Missouri, Crow worked as a music teacher at the Kellison elementary school in Fenton, Missouri. Teaching during the day gave her the opportunity to sing in bands on the weekends. She was later introduced to local musician and record producer Jay Oliver. He had a studio in the basement of his parents' home in St. Louis and helped her by using her in advertising jingles. Her first jingle was a 'back to school' spot for the St Louis department store Famous-Barr. Soon after she sang in commercial jingles for McDonald's (stated on the Today Show 4/19/17 she did not create) and Toyota. She was quoted in a 60 Minutes segment as saying she made $40,000 on her McDonald's ad alone. Crow toured with Michael Jackson as a backing vocalist during his Bad World Tour 1987-89 and often performed with Jackson on \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\". She also recorded background vocals for performances for a number of established artists such as Stevie Wonder, Belinda Carlisle and Don Henley. In 1989, Crow contributed backing vocals to the Neal Schon track \"Smoke of the Revolution\" from his album Late Nite. Crow also sang in the short-lived Steven Bochco drama Cop Rock in 1990. That same year, her song \"Heal Somebody\" appeared in the film Bright Angel. The following year, she performed \"Hundreds of Tears\", which was included in the Point Break soundtrack, and sang a duet with Kenny Loggins on the track \"I Would Do Anything\", from his album Leap of Faith.
