{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 2014, Paulini signed a joint record deal with Ambition Records and Decca Records Australia. She became the first artist signed to the reactivated Decca Records label in Australia. Paulini released \"Air It All Out\" as the lead single from her third studio album Come Alive on 17 October 2014. Co-written by Paulini in New York, she explained that \"the song is about letting go of negativity, doubt and fear - breathing in and exhaling positivity and purpose.\" \"By My Side\" was released as the second and final single from Come Alive on 15 May 2015. Co-written in Sydney by Paulini and producer Adam Reily, \"By My Side\" was dedicated to Paulini's older sister Litia who battled and overcame breast cancer. Paulini stated that the song is lyrically \"about my journey over the past few years and coming into my skin after a struggle to find my voice, my artistry and above all, loving myself with the help of loved ones by my side.\" Both \"Air It All Out\" and \"By My Side\" failed to make any significant impact on the ARIA charts. Paulini's third album Come Alive was released on 29 May 2015, almost nine years after the release of her second album Superwoman (2006). Come Alive marked a departure from Paulini's previous R&B releases, with a more commercial adult contemporary pop sound. She worked on the album for five years in Berlin, London, Los Angeles, New York City and Paris with several writers and producers, including Chris Rosa, Erik \"Blue2th\" Griggs and Philippe-Marc Anquetil. Paulini stated that she wanted to take her time with the album to concentrate on improving her songwriting, having co-written all but two tracks on Come Alive. Come Alive debuted at number 25 on the ARIA Albums Chart and surpassed Superwoman's peak position of number 72. Paulini's fourth studio album Merry Christmas was released on 6 November 2015. It was Paulini's first Christmas album and second overall Christmas release, following her 2004 EP, Amazing Grace: Songs for Christmas. Paulini stated that the release was her \"way of saying 'thank you'\" to the fans for allowing her to perform and share the spirit of Christmas at \"communities all around Australia\" every year. Featuring cover versions of popular Christmas tunes, Merry Christmas failed to impact the ARIA charts. Paulini promoted the album with an eight-date tour at various Christmas carols events on the East Coast. Paulini collaborated with The Wiggles on the song \"Do the Pretzel\" for their 2017 album Duets, and appeared in the music video included on the DVD of the same name. In April 2017, she made her musical theatre debut in the Australian production of The Bodyguard, which is based on Whitney Houston's 1992 film of the same name. Paulini played the lead role of Rachel Marron--originally portrayed by Houston in the film--a fictional pop superstar who is stalked by a fan and falls in love with her bodyguard. Paulini took acting lessons and increased her fitness to prepare for the role, which included singing and running on the treadmill at the same time. The Bodyguard musical played shows in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne from April until October 2017. Paulini's performance in the musical was well-received by critics and audiences.
