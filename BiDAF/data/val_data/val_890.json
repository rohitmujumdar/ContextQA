{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In August 1989, White Lion released their third album, Big Game, a musically eclectic follow-up to Pride that featured the single \"Little Fighter\" (which peaked at No. 52), in Memory of The Rainbow Warrior, a Greenpeace boat which was destroyed by the French. A cover of Golden Earring's \"Radar Love\" (which peaked at No. 59) was released as the second single and \"Cry for Freedom\" was released as the third single. \"Going Home Tonight\" was released as the album's final single. The album quickly went gold, with a peak of No. 19 on the album charts. The band's success continued with more constant touring. After two years of writing and recording, White Lion released their fourth album Mane Attraction in the spring of 1991. More of a \"back to basics\" album, centering on strong hooks and melodic hard rock, the album was received well by the fans. Tramp also changed his singing style on this disc, as he was no longer comfortable singing high. Unfortunately, the album failed to reach the top 20 like the last two albums, charting at No. 61 on The Billboard 200. It received little or no airplay due to the recent Grunge explosion. The album featured the singles \"Love Don't Come Easy\" which peaked at number 24 on The Mainstream Rock Charts, \"Lights and Thunder\" and a re-recorded version of the band's debut single \"Broken Heart\", all of which featured music videos. \"Out with the Boys\" was released as a rare promo single and \"Farewell to You\" featured a music video montage. The album also contained White Lion's only instrumental song, \"Blue Monday\", a tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan, who had died while the band was writing for the album. \"Till Death Do Us Part\" has become popular in the Philippines, where most radio stations are playing that song. Greg D'Angelo and James LoMenzo left the band soon after the album's release, citing \"musical differences,\" but White Lion carried on with bassist Tommy T-Bone Caradonna and drummer Jimmy DeGrasso (Megadeth, Alice Cooper, Suicidal Tendencies, Y&T, Fiona).
