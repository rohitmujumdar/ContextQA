{"paragraphs": [{"context": "The Seekers were offered a twelve-month position as on-board entertainment on the Sitmar Line passenger cruise ship Fairsky in March 1964. In May, they travelled to the U.K. and had intended to return to Australia after staying ten weeks, but upon arrival they were offered work by a London booking agency, the Grade Organisation. They signed there with World Record Club and issued a single, \"Myra\", co-written by the group. The group regularly appeared on a British TV show series, \"Call in on Carroll\", hosted by Ronnie Carroll. After filling in on a bill headlined by folk singer Dusty Springfield, they met her brother, songwriter and producer Tom Springfield, who had experience with writing folk-pop material and lyrics/tunes with the siblings' earlier group The Springfields. He penned \"I'll Never Find Another You\", which they recorded in November 1964. It was released by EMI Records, on their Columbia Graphophone Company (Columbia) label, in December and was championed by the offshore radio station \"Radio Caroline\" which frequently played and promoted their music. Despite the fact that the group had not signed a contract with EMI, the single reached the U.K. \"Top 50\" and began selling well. In February 1965, it reached No.1 in the U.K. and Australia, and No.4 in the United States where it was released on EMI's Capitol Records label. \"I'll Never Find Another You\" was the seventh biggest-selling single in Britain for 1965 though their own \"The Carnival Is Over\", released later in the year, would eventually eclipse it - and went on to sell 1.75 million copies worldwide. The Seekers were the first Australian pop group to have a \"Top 5\" hit in all three countries - Australia, U.K. and U.S.A. Australian music historian, Ian McFarlane described their style as \"concentrated on a bright, uptempo sound, although they were too pop oriented to be considered strictly folk and too folk to be rock.\" The distinctive soprano voice of Durham, the group's vocal harmonies and memorable songs encouraged the British media, including the national broadcasting agency on radio and television, the BBC, to give them exposure, allowing them to appeal to a broad cross-section of the young British folk, pop and rock music audience.
