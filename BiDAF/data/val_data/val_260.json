{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Wilson worked as a lecturer at Cornell University in 1886-87, where he joined the Irving Literary Society. He next taught at Bryn Mawr College from 1885 until 1888, teaching ancient Greek and Roman history; while there, he refused offers from the universities of Michigan and Indiana. When Ellen was pregnant with their first child in 1886, the couple decided that Ellen should go to her Aunt Louisa Brown's residence in Gainesville, Georgia, to have their first child; she arrived just one day before the baby, Margaret, was born in April 1886. Their second child, Jessie, was born in August 1887. In 1888, Wilson left Bryn Mawr for Wesleyan University; it was a controversial move, as he had signed a three-year contract with Bryn Mawr in 1887. Both parties claimed contract violations and the matter subsided. At Wesleyan, was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa and coached the football team and founded the debate team, which bears his name. In February 1890, with the help of friends, Wilson was elected by the Princeton University board to the Chair of Jurisprudence and Political Economy, at an annual salary of $3,000. He continued a previous practice of reserving time for a six-week course in administration at Johns Hopkins. He was also a faculty member of the short-lived coordinate college, Evelyn College for Women. Additionally, Wilson became the first lecturer of Constitutional Law at New York Law School, where he taught with Charles Evans Hughes. Representing the American Whig Society, Wilson delivered an oration at Princeton's sesquicentennial celebration (1896) entitled \"Princeton in the Nation's Service,\" which was the origin for the school's motto. Wilson became annoyed that Princeton was not living up to its potential, complaining, \"There's a little college down in Kentucky which in 60 years has graduated more men who have acquired prominence and fame than has Princeton in her 150 years.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "n", "yesno": "x", "question": "where did he go to high school?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1916}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1916}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1916}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1916}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1916}], "id": "C_d6ee3d502fc4450591c2f33f13c24861_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1916}}, {"followup": "n", "yesno": "y", "question": "did he go to college?", "answers": [{"text": "Wilson worked as a lecturer at Cornell University in 1886-87, where he joined the Irving Literary Society.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Wilson worked as a lecturer at Cornell University", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Wilson worked as a lecturer at Cornell University", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Wilson worked as a lecturer at Cornell University in 1886-87,", "answer_start": 0}], "id": "C_d6ee3d502fc4450591c2f33f13c24861_0_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "Wilson worked as a lecturer at Cornell University in 1886-87,", "answer_start": 0}}, {"followup": "n", "yesno": "x", "question": "what did he lecture?", "answers": [{"text": "He next taught at Bryn Mawr College from 1885 until 1888, teaching ancient Greek and Roman history; while there,", "answer_start": 107}, {"text": "He next taught at Bryn Mawr College from 1885 until 1888, teaching ancient Greek and Roman history;", "answer_start": 107}, {"text": "teaching ancient Greek and Roman history;", "answer_start": 165}], "id": "C_d6ee3d502fc4450591c2f33f13c24861_0_q#2", "orig_answer": {"text": "teaching ancient Greek and Roman history;", "answer_start": 165}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "why did he leave Cornell?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1916}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1916}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1916}], "id": "C_d6ee3d502fc4450591c2f33f13c24861_0_q#3", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1916}}, {"followup": "n", "yesno": "x", "question": "what did he teach there?", "answers": [{"text": "ancient Greek and Roman history;", "answer_start": 174}, {"text": "ancient Greek and Roman history;", "answer_start": 174}, {"text": "teaching ancient Greek and Roman history;", "answer_start": 165}, {"text": "ancient Greek and Roman history;", "answer_start": 174}, {"text": "ancient Greek and Roman history;", "answer_start": 174}], "id": "C_d6ee3d502fc4450591c2f33f13c24861_0_q#4", "orig_answer": {"text": "ancient Greek and Roman history;", "answer_start": 174}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "where did he teach after Bryn?", "answers": [{"text": "In 1888, Wilson left Bryn Mawr for Wesleyan University;", "answer_start": 599}, {"text": "In 1888, Wilson left Bryn Mawr for Wesleyan University;", "answer_start": 599}, {"text": "In 1888, Wilson left Bryn Mawr for Wesleyan University;", "answer_start": 599}, {"text": "In 1888, Wilson left Bryn Mawr for Wesleyan University;", "answer_start": 599}, {"text": "Wesleyan University;", "answer_start": 634}], "id": "C_d6ee3d502fc4450591c2f33f13c24861_0_q#5", "orig_answer": {"text": "Wesleyan University;", "answer_start": 634}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "how long did he teach there?", "answers": [{"text": "he had signed a three-year contract with Bryn Mawr in 1887.", "answer_start": 687}, {"text": "In February 1890, with the help of friends, Wilson was elected by the Princeton University board to the Chair of Jurisprudence", "answer_start": 940}, {"text": "February 1890,", "answer_start": 943}], "id": "C_d6ee3d502fc4450591c2f33f13c24861_0_q#6", "orig_answer": {"text": "February 1890,", "answer_start": 943}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "why did he leave?", "answers": [{"text": "Both parties claimed contract violations and the matter subsided.", "answer_start": 747}, {"text": "In February 1890, with the help of friends, Wilson was elected by the Princeton University board to the Chair of Jurisprudence and Political Economy,", "answer_start": 940}, {"text": "Wilson was elected by the Princeton University board to the Chair of Jurisprudence and Political Economy,", "answer_start": 984}], "id": "C_d6ee3d502fc4450591c2f33f13c24861_0_q#7", "orig_answer": {"text": "Wilson was elected by the Princeton University board to the Chair of Jurisprudence and Political Economy,", "answer_start": 984}}], "id": "C_d6ee3d502fc4450591c2f33f13c24861_0"}], "section_title": "Academic career", "background": "Wilson was born to a Scots-Irish American family in Staunton, Virginia, on December 28, 1856, at 18-24 North Coalter Street (now the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library).
