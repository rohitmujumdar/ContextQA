{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 1971, Murphey returned to Texas and became part of the so-called Outlaw country movement, playing alongside other maverick performers such as Willie Nelson and Jerry Jeff Walker. He created a unique sound that combined his country, rock, and folk influences. It was during this period that Murphey wrote \"Geronimo's Cadillac\", a song about Native American rights that later became an unofficial anthem for the American Indian Movement in the early 1970s. In 1971, Murphey was signed to A&M Records by Bob Johnston, who discovered him in a Dallas club, the Rubiayat. Johnston had produced some of the country's most popular recording artists, including Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, and Simon and Garfunkel. In 1972, Johnston produced Murphey's first album Geronimo's Cadillac in Nashville, Tennessee. The sound of the album reflects Murphey's love of country, folk, and blues music. Murphey's early gospel influences are also evident throughout the album. The title track was released as a single, and reached the Top 40 on the US pop charts. In addition to the title track, the album included \"Boy from the Country\", \"What Am I Doin' Hangin' Around?\", and \"Michael Angelo's Blues\". Rolling Stone magazine proclaimed, \"On the strength of his first album alone, Michael Murphey is the best new songwriter in the country.\" In 1973, Murphey followed up with the album Cosmic Cowboy Souvenir, which continued the urban cowboy theme of the first album. The album included \"Cosmic Cowboy, Pt. 1\", \"Alleys of Austin\", and \"Rolling Hills\". Throughout this period, Murphey's band included Bob Livingston and Gary P. Nunn, the author of \"London Homesick Blues\". He performed a number of times at the Armadillo World Headquarters, and his photo was even used for the original cover of Jan Reid's book, The Improbable Rise of Redneck Rock. But Michael Murphey's musical vision was expanding beyond the confines of the outlaw country sound and moving toward a much more ambitious musical tapestry.
