{"paragraphs": [{"context": "After a five-year sabbatical from film acting, Rai made a comeback with Sanjay Gupta's drama-thriller Jazbaa, co-starring Shabana Azmi and Irrfan Khan. A remake of the Korean thriller Seven Days (2007), the film saw Rai play the role of Anuradha Verma, a criminal lawyer who is forced to defend a rapist in exchange for her daughter's safety. The film received mixed reviews from critics but turned out to be a profitable venture at box-office. Shomini Sen from CNN-IBN writing, \"Jazbaa scores only because of the performances. Aishwarya Rai grunts and screeches on some scenes but manages to deliver a convincing performance.\" In 2016, Rai starred in Omung Kumar's biographical drama Sarbjit. The film is based on the life of Indian farmer Sarabjit Singh, who was convicted of terrorism by a Pakistani court, and how his sister Dalbir Kaur fought relentlessly for his release. Rai played the role of the sister of Sarabjit Singh (played by Randeep Hooda). The film premiered at the 69th Cannes Film Festival, and received mixed reactions from critics. Few reviewers expressed that Rai was \"miscast\" as she neither looked nor sounded like a Sikh woman. Her Punjabi accent and her over-the-top performance in few scenes was largely criticized, though several critics took note of how much she stood out in the film's quieter scenes. Rajeev Masand summarised that \"she's required to scream and shout and weep copiously to express her anguish; the shrillness does her no favors. In quieter moments - like one in which Dalbir can't bear to part with her stillborn baby - the actress shines.\" Nonetheless her role earned her tenth Filmfare Best Actress nomination. The film underperformed at the box-office. Rai's final release of 2016 was Karan Johar's romantic drama Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, alongside Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma in which she played the role of a poetess named Saba. Rai received mostly positive notice for her performance despite having limited screen time. Nihit Bhav of Indiatimes wrote that \"seeing [Rai] in the role of a confident seductress is a welcome change\". The film emerged as a major commercial success with revenues of over Rs2 billion (US$31 million). As of January 2018, Rai has filmed the part of a singer in the musical comedy Fanne Khan, co-starring Anil Kapoor and Rajkummar Rao. She will also play a woman suffering from dissociative identity disorder in a remake of the 1967 film Raat Aur Din.
