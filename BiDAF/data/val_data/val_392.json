{"paragraphs": [{"context": "P.O.D.'s third studio album, 1999's The Fundamental Elements of Southtown, spawned the hits \"Southtown\" and \"Rock the Party (Off the Hook)\", which was their first video to reach No. 1 on MTV's Total Request Live. The song \"School of Hard Knocks\" was featured on the soundtrack for Little Nicky while both \"Southtown\" and \"Rock the Party\" appeared in the movie. All three music videos endured heavy play on MTV2 and the songs were rock radio hits. The album went on to become RIAA certified platinum. On September 11, 2001 P.O.D. released their fourth studio album, Satellite. The album's first single, \"Alive\", went on to become one of MTV's and MTV2's top played videos of the year. The video's popularity, as well as the song's positive message, helped the song become a huge modern rock radio hit and it was Grammy nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance in 2002. Also in 2002, the band contributed the song \"America\" to Santana's album Shaman. The album's second single, \"Youth of the Nation\", was influenced in part by the school shootings at Santana High School, Columbine High School, and Granite Hills High School. It was Grammy nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance in 2003. The 2002 singles, \"Boom\" and \"Satellite\", also became quite popular. In addition, the concluding track of the album, \"Portrait,\" was Grammy nominated for Best Metal Performance in 2003. It was used in the comedy film Here Comes the Boom, starring Kevin James. Satellite went on to become RIAA-certified triple platinum. The author of Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music has described P.O.D. as \"One of the biggest success stories in recent Christian music.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What can you tell me about fundamental elements of southtown?", "answers": [{"text": "The Fundamental Elements of Southtown, spawned the hits \"Southtown\" and \"Rock the Party (Off the Hook)\",", "answer_start": 36}, {"text": "P.O.D.'s third studio album,", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "The Fundamental Elements of Southtown, spawned the hits \"Southtown\" and \"Rock the Party (Off the Hook)\", which was their first video to reach No. 1 on MTV's Total Request Live.", "answer_start": 36}, {"text": "P.O.D.'s third studio album, 1999's The Fundamental Elements of Southtown,", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "O.D.'s third studio album, 1999's The Fundamental Elements of Southtown, spawned the hits \"Southtown\" and \"Rock the Party (Off the Hook)\",", "answer_start": 2}], "id": "C_b7110139f6434af1a640af0396ead0c0_1_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "O.D.'s third studio album, 1999's The Fundamental Elements of Southtown, spawned the hits \"Southtown\" and \"Rock the Party (Off the Hook)\",", "answer_start": 2}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "Was it controversial?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1655}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1655}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1655}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1655}], "id": "C_b7110139f6434af1a640af0396ead0c0_1_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1655}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What was notable about it?", "answers": [{"text": "It was Grammy nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance in 2003.", "answer_start": 1124}, {"text": "All three music videos endured heavy play on MTV2 and the songs were rock radio hits.
