{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In the early 1990s, she continued performing around Greece with Nikos Karvelas, with appearances at \"Diogenis Palace\" and then at \"Rex\". In November 1991, Vissi and Karvelas starred in the first Greek rock opera, Daimones (\"Demons\"). It was based on a libretto by Stavros Sideras and staged at Attikon Theater in Athens for two years. Roger Williams was the director and Anna Vissi (Queen & Rozanne), Yannis Samsiaris (Daniel), Bessy Malfa (Witch & Loa) and John Modinos (Inquisitor) were the leading actors. Daimones was played on foreign TV stations and attracted the attention of Broadway agents. Vissi described it as an \"artistic achievement\" in her career; however, the play received mostly negative reviews from professional critics and contributed to the relatively unsuccessful period Vissi faced in the early 1990s. Vissi has defended the play, saying \"I did something important and advanced for the Greek music scene!\" but admitted that she lost a lot of money from the production. She is considering modernising and relaunching the production in the 2010s. A year later, in October 1993, Vissi landed the leading role of Aphrodite, in the one-act opera Ode to the Gods by Stavros Sideras. It was held only once in Limassol, Cyprus, during the celebrations for the Commonwealth Day. Then-president of the Republic of Cyprus, Glafkos Clerides, and Queen Elizabeth II, were amongst the audience. The following years, Karvelas and Vissi released the albums Lambo (1992), Emeis (1992), Live! (1993), Re! (1994), and O! Kypros (1995), an album with traditional Cypriot songs. In 1994, she was the hostess on the ANT1 weekly TV show Me Agapi, Anna. The show was cancelled and in 2008 the production company filed a lawsuit against Vissi claiming \"unprofessional behavior of the singer\" because the agreement was for 40 episodes and Vissi dropped out after 10 episodes. The juridical conflict between Vissi and the production company appeared to come to an end when the Court of Appeal of Athens led to the final compromise of the two sides to the sum of EUR400,000. A sum that the singer would supposed to pay in the company against the initial sum of 2.3 million Euros. Ultimately Vissi was vindicated and the decision of Supreme Court ruled that EUR400,000 was a lot more from the amount that Vissi should actually pay and decided to give the half amount of money. One year later she did a concert in Cyprus, supporting the defences of the island.
