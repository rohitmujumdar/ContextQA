{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Having learned to play guitar, Spector performed \"Rock Island Line\" in a talent show at Fairfax High School, where he was a student. While at Fairfax, he joined a loose-knit community of aspiring musicians, including Lou Adler, Bruce Johnston, Steve Douglas, and Sandy Nelson, the last of whom played drums on Spector's first record release, \"To Know Him Is to Love Him\". With three friends from high school, Marshall Leib, Sandy Nelson, and Annette Kleinbard, Spector formed a group, the Teddy Bears. During this period, record producer Stan Ross -- co-owner of Gold Star Studios in Hollywood -- began to tutor Spector in record production and exerted a major influence on Spector's production style. In 1958, the Teddy Bears recorded the Spector-penned \"Don't You Worry My Little Pet\", which helped them secure a deal with Era Records. At their next session, they recorded another song Spector had written--this one inspired by the epitaph on Spector's father's tombstone. Released on Era's subsidiary label, Dore Records, \"To Know Him Is to Love Him\" reached number one on Billboard Hot 100 singles chart on December 1, 1958, selling over a million copies by year's end. It was the seventh number-one single on the newly formed chart. Following the success of their debut, the group signed with Imperial Records. Their next single, \"I Don't Need You Anymore\", reached number 91. They released several more recordings, including an album, The Teddy Bears Sing!, but failed to reach the top 100 in US sales. The group disbanded in 1959.
