The album has skits to give it a \"classic feel\", and includes features from multiple artists, including Lil Wayne, Miguel, and Nas. The album's production was primarily handled by No I.D., and Key Wane along with additional production from Hit-Boy, and Da Internz, Mike Dean, Travis Scott, Xaphoon Jones and Young Chop among others. Big Sean also stated in an interview that he was in the studio with fellow Detroit native Eminem. Sean went on to say they made a \"Detroit classic\" but he is unsure if it will be on Hall of Fame because of \"timing issues\". Hall of Fame had spawned five singles, \"Guap\", \"Switch Up\" featuring Common, \"Beware\" featuring Jhene Aiko and Lil Wayne, \"Fire\", and \"Ashley\" featuring Miguel. A month prior to the release of Hall of Fame, Big Sean told Complex that he had already begun work on his third album due to the inspiration from his new relationship.
