{"paragraphs": [{"context": "On October 26, 2014 against the Indianapolis Colts, Roethlisberger completed 40 of 49 passes for 522 yards and 6 touchdowns as the Steelers defeated the Indianapolis Colts 51-34. With the win, Roethlisberger became just the fourth quarterback in NFL history to get 100 wins in his first 150 starts. He also became the first NFL quarterback to pass for over 500 yards twice in a career. He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his effort against the Colts. In the next game, a 43-23 victory over the Baltimore Ravens, he had 340 passing yards and six passing touchdowns to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the second consecutive week. In the Steelers Week 15 matchup against the Atlanta Falcons, Roethlisberger completed 27 of 35 passes for 360 yards in a 27-20 victory. The victory made Roethlisberger only the sixth quarterback in NFL history to have defeated at least 31 different teams, joining Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Kerry Collins, Brett Favre, and Peyton Manning; like Brady, Roethlisberger has only played with one team and thus hasn't played against the Steelers. The Steelers lost 41-38 in Roethlisberger's only other matchup against Atlanta in 2006, and he was suspended for the Steelers 15-9 overtime victory against the Falcons in 2010. During 2014, Roethlisberger passed for career highs in yards with 4,952, completion percentage with 67.1, completions with 408, and attempts with 608. Roethlisberger also matched his career high in passing touchdowns with 32, as well as posting a passer rating of 103.3, the second highest of his career. His 4,952 yards were tied for most on the season with Drew Brees, but Roethlisberger reached the mark with fewer completions. The Steelers had a 11-5 record and finished first in the AFC North. They then lost in the Wild Card round of the playoffs against the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 30-17. He was named to his third career Pro Bowl for the 2014 season. He was ranked 26th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015. On March 13, Roethlisberger signed a five-year contract extension with the Steelers. Roethlisberger went 26 for 38 for 351 yards, one touchdown pass and one interception during a 28-21 loss against the Patriots to kick off the 2015 NFL season. However, Roethlisberger and the Steelers would bounce back to win their next two games against the San Francisco 49ers and the St. Louis Rams. In the 43-18 victory over the 49ers, he had 369 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week. During the September 27 game against the St. Louis Rams, Roethlisberger suffered a sprained MCL and a bone bruise. Roethlisberger missed the Steelers' next four games, during which Michael Vick and Landry Jones combined to go 2-2. Roethlisberger sustained another injury against the Oakland Raiders on November 8, 2015, suffering a left mid-foot sprain. Due to this injury, he did not start the following week against the Cleveland Browns, although he was listed as active for the game. However, early in the first quarter, Landry Jones sprained his left ankle, resulting in Roethlisberger entering the game in relief for only the second time in his career. Roethlisberger threw for 379 yards and 3 touchdowns on the way to a Steelers win and an AFC Offensive Player of the Week award; his 379 passing yards were the most by a quarterback in relief since Don Strock threw for 403 yards in the Epic in Miami. On November 29, Roethlisberger threw for 456 yards against the Seattle Seahawks, but he also threw 2 interceptions, and the Seahawks took a 39-30 win. The Steelers clinched a playoff spot with a 10-6 record, finishing second in the AFC North behind the Cincinnati Bengals. They then defeated the Bengals by a score of 18-16 in the Wild Card round, but lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos in the Divisional round by a score of 23-16. Roethlisberger was named to his fourth career Pro Bowl and was ranked 21st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016. On October 8, 2017, against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Roethlisberger threw a career-high five interceptions as the Steelers lost by a score of 30-9. On November 16 against the Tennessee Titans, he completed 30 of 45 passes for 299 yards and four touchdowns as the Steelers won 40-17. In that game, Roethlisburger recorded his 4,000th career completion on a 3-yard pass to tight end Jesse James. On December 4, Roethlisberger became the 8th quarterback to reach 50,000 career passing yards in a game against the Cincinnati Bengals. During Sunday Night Football against the Baltimore Ravens in Week 14, he completed 44 of 66 passes for 506 yards and 2 touchdowns in a 39-38 win, becoming the first player in NFL history with three career 500-yard passing games. With the win, the Steelers clinched a playoff berth for the AFC North pennant. He also set single-game career highs in both completions and attempts. His 44 completions set an NFL record for the most completions in a non-overtime game and were the second most in NFL history behind Drew Bledsoe's 45 completions in 1994. His performance in Week 14 earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week. During Week 15 against the Patriots, Roethlisberger finished with 281 passing yards, 2 touchdowns, and an interception. In the closing seconds of the fourth quarter, two controversial moments occurred; Roethlisberger threw a potential game-winning touchdown to tight end Jesse James, but was overturned after James seemingly lost control when the ball touched the ground. Two plays later, Roethlisberger faked a spike to pass, which was intercepted by Duron Harmon, resulting in the Steelers losing 24-27, and allowing the Patriots to clinch the AFC East. On December 19, 2017, Roethlisberger was named to his fourth consecutive and sixth career Pro Bowl along with his star receiver Antonio Brown and three of his starting offensive lineman among others. The Steelers finished the 2017 season with a 13-3 record, clinching the AFC North division. In the AFC Divisional Round, the Steelers faced the Jaguars. Although the Jaguars had the #1 passing defense in 2017, Roethlisberger finished with 469 passing yards, 5 touchdowns, and an interception, but the Steelers lost 42-45.
