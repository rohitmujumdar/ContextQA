{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Sabonis is married to Ingrida Mikelionyte, the first Miss Lithuania, a fashion model, and a movie actress. They have a daughter named Ausrine, and three sons: Zygimantas, Tautvydas, and Domantas - the last two being born in the cities his father was playing, Valladolid and Portland. Once Sabonis left the NBA, the family moved to the Spanish coastal city of Malaga. Tautvydas played for the Unicaja Malaga junior team, and was a member of the Lithuania under-19 national team that won the 2011 FIBA Under-19 World Cup. He later played in Mallorca. The other two sons have also represented Lithuanian national teams, in FIBA youth tournaments of their age groups; in August 2011, Domantas was touted as Lithuania's top under-15 player. During the 2012 FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship, Domantas averaged 14.1 points and 14.4 rebounds per game. Domantas went on to play at Unicaja, but did not play under a professional contract; which enabled him to sign to play college basketball at Gonzaga, beginning in the 2014-15 season. After playing two seasons at Gonzaga, Domantas declared for the 2016 NBA draft, and was selected 11th overall by the Orlando Magic. He was immediately sent to the Oklahoma City Thunder, in a trade that involved three other players. Zygimantas chose not to follow Domantas to the U.S., and is currently a free agent, after spending his last season with Pozuelo. In September 2011, Sabonis suffered a heart attack, while playing basketball in Lithuania. Doctors said that the heart attack was not life-threatening. According to his son, Domantas, Arvydas is a huge fan of the Boston Celtics, his favorite basketball player is Larry Bird, and his favorite color is green.
