They have four children: Katherine Eunice (born 1989), Christina Maria Aurelia (born 1991), Patrick Arnold (born 1993), and Christopher Sargent Shriver (born 1997). On May 9, 2011, Schwarzenegger and Shriver announced their separation after 25 years of marriage, with Shriver moving out of the couple's Brentwood mansion. In a message for her Twitter followers posted on May 13, 2011, Shriver said: \"Thank you all for the kindness, support and compassion. I am humbled by the love. Thank you.\" On May 17, 2011, Schwarzenegger publicly admitted to fathering a child with a longtime member of their household staff, Mildred Patricia Baena, 14 years earlier, and before his election as Governor of California. He confessed to Shriver only after she confronted him with the information, having earlier confirmed what she had suspected about the child in a confrontation with Baena. Shriver described Schwarzenegger's admission as \"painful and heartbreaking.\" She declined to speak further on the issue, saying: \"As a mother, my concern is for the children. I ask for compassion, respect and privacy as my children and I try to rebuild our lives and heal.\" Shriver filed for divorce on July 1, 2011. citing \"irreconcilable differences\". In 2013, Shriver began dating political consultant Matthew Dowd, the strategist for Arnold Schwarzenegger's 2006 reelection campaign.
