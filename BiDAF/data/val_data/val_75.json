{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Despite the steady flow of hit singles, tensions between Spector and the Crystals mounted. Already unhappy with having been replaced by Love and the Blossoms on two singles, the Crystals were even more upset when Spector began focusing much of his time on his other girl group the Ronettes. Not only did the Ronettes become Philles Records' priority act, the Ronettes actually replaced the Crystals on four album tracks on the 1963 compilation LP The Crystals Sing the Greatest Hits. As well, there were disputes about royalties, with the Crystals feeling that Spector was withholding royalty money that was owed to them. Two failed Crystals singles followed before the band left Spector's Philles Records for United Artists Records in 1964. \"Little Boy\", which reached #92, was a Wall Of Sound production that was layered multiple times, which meant that the vocals were hard to distinguish from the music. \"All Grown Up\", their final Philles single (of which two versions exist), only reached #98. 1964 also saw the departure of Wright, who was replaced by Frances Collins, a dancer whom they had met while touring; toward the end of that year Alston departed leaving the group a trio. As a trio, they recorded two singles for United Artists, \"My Place\" and \"You Can't Tie a Good Girl Down\". One more single was released by Barbara, Dee Dee and Mary on the tiny Michelle Records in 1967 (\"Ring-a-Ting-a-Ling\") and they disbanded in 1967 (see 1967 in music). They reunited in 1971 (see 1971 in music) and still perform today. Kenniebrew is the only original Crystal who remained active throughout their touring from the seventies to the present. Dee Dee continues to carry on The Crystals legacy by performing with Patricia Pritchett-Lewis, a member since 2005, and Melissa \"MelSoulTree\" Grant (aka Mel-Soul-Tree), a member since 2002. The current trio of Crystals are currently promoting a CD project entitled Live In Asia, which they recorded live in Singapore. The lead vocalist for The Crystals' biggest hits is La La Brooks. After living in the UK for two decades, La La returned to the US in 2001 and currently performs across the world. Barbara Alston died at a Charlotte hospital on February 16, 2018, at age 74.
