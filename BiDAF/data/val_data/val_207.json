{"paragraphs": [{"context": "When Burns turned 90 in 1986, the city of Los Angeles renamed the northern end of Hamel Road \"George Burns Road.\" City regulations prohibited naming a city street after a living person, but an exception was made for Burns. In celebration of Burns' 99th birthday in January 1995, Los Angeles renamed the eastern end of Alden Drive \"Gracie Allen Drive.\" Burns was present at the unveiling ceremony (one of his last public appearances) where he quipped, \"It's good to be here at the corner of Burns & Allen. At my age, it's good to be anywhere!\" George Burns Road and Gracie Allen Drive cross just a few blocks west of the Beverly Center mall in the heart of the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Burns remained in good health for most of his life, in part thanks to a daily exercise regimen of swimming, walks, sit-ups, and push-ups. He bought new Cadillacs every year and drove until the age of 93, when he stopped due to becoming so short that he couldn't see over the steering wheel. After that, Burns had chauffeurs drive him around. In his later years, he also had difficulty reading fine print. Burns suffered a head injury after falling in his bathtub in July 1994 and underwent surgery to remove fluid in his skull. Burns never fully recovered and all performances celebrating his 100th birthday were canceled. In December 1995, a month before his 100th birthday, Burns was well enough to attend a Christmas party hosted by Frank Sinatra (who turned 80 that month), where he reportedly caught the flu, which weakened him further. When Burns was 96, he had signed a lifetime contract with Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas to perform stand-up comedy there, which included the guarantee of a show on his centenary, January 20, 1996. When that day actually came however, he was too weak to deliver the planned performance. He released a statement joking how he would love for his 100th birthday to have \"a night with Sharon Stone\". His final public appearance was in at the MCG in Melbourne, Australia, where he opened the 1996 AFL Premiership Season on February 8. On March 9, 1996, 49 days after his centenary, Burns died in his Beverly Hills home at age 100. His funeral was held three days later at the Wee Kirk o' the Heather church in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, Glendale. As much as he looked forward to reaching the age of 100, Burns also stated, about a year before he died, that he also looked forward to death, saying that on the day he would die, he would be with Gracie again in Heaven. Upon being interred with Gracie, the crypt's marker was changed from, \"Grace Allen Burns-Beloved Wife And Mother (1902-1964)\" to \"Gracie Allen (1902-1964) & George Burns (1896-1996)-Together Again\". George had said that he wanted Gracie to have top billing.
