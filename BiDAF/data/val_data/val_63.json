{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Carter began his acting and singing career at a young age, when his mother enrolled him in voice lessons and dance lessons in ballet and tap at Karl and DiMarco's School of Theatre and Dance when he was 10. He performed in several commercials, such as the Florida State Lottery and The Money Store. He played the lead role in the fourth grade production of Phantom of the Opera at Miles Elementary School. He also did an educational video called \"Reach For The Book\", a show called \"The Klub\" and performing at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers home games for two years. He also made an appearance in the 1990 Johnny Depp film Edward Scissorhands as a child playing on a Slip 'N Slide. One of his dance teachers, Sandy, placed him in his first group called \"Nick and the Angels\". Between 1989-1993, Carter covered a various number of popular songs by other artists, including \"Breaking Up Is Hard to Do\" and \"Uptown Girl\" and a few original songs that he would perform at events. These recordings ended up on an unofficial release called Before the Backstreet Boys 1989-1993 by Dynamic Discs, Inc released in October 2002. It is revealed that through several auditions, Nick met AJ McLean and Howie Dorough and they became friends. After a troubled upbringing, he put in a winning performance on the 1992 New Original Amateur Hour at age 12. At 11 years old, Carter also auditioned for Disney's The Mickey Mouse Club and the Backstreet Boys around October 1992. He was not chosen right away to be a part of the Backstreet Boys because his mother Jane wanted him to join The Mickey Mouse Club so that he could stay in school. A week later, he was asked to join the group and was given the choice of either joining The Mickey Mouse Club with a $50,000 contract or this new music group. Nick chose to go with the group instead. The Mickey Mouse Club was cancelled a few years later. After he joined the group, he had his own personal tutor on tour.
