{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Since the 2012 premiere of The Aquabats! Super Show!, The Aquabats largely cut back on extensive touring in order to accommodate their television production schedule, once again limiting their live shows to occasional performances within the Southwestern United States. In April 2013, the band carried out a six-show tour of Europe and the United Kingdom, concluding with an appearance at the Groezrock punk rock festival in Belgium. The following June, The Aquabats were once again featured on the Warped Tour, though only played eight shows in the Southwest region. Despite playing a limited portion of the tour, the band were regularly featured on the second season of Fuse's Warped Roadies, a reality series documenting the road crew of the Warped Tour, where they were most notably the subject of one episode in which they incur the wrath of a stage manager for repeatedly playing over their set times. On March 17, 2014, in celebration of their 20th anniversary as a band, The Aquabats announced the first leg of their \"20th Anniversary Tour\" for May, their first extensive headlining United States tour in years, covering fifteen shows in nine states on the East Coast. The following July, the band carried out five more dates across California, Washington and Oregon, then announced eleven more dates covering six states across the western half of the country. In May 2017, following another stretch of relative inactivity for most of 2015 and 2016, The Aquabats announced a 13-date tour of the American Midwest and East Coast, supported by Reggie and the Full Effect, C. J. Ramone and Kepi Ghoulie, subsequently followed by a six-date tour of the West Coast in October with Dog Party. Ticket options for these shows included \"Super Rad Packages\" with bonus exclusive merchandise, most notably a split 7\" single of full-length versions of the Super Show! songs \"Burger Rain\" and \"Beat Fishin'\", marking the release of The Aquabats' first new studio recordings since Hi-Five Soup. Following the 20th anniversary of 1997's The Fury of The Aquabats!, The Aquabats announced plans to release a remixed and remastered edition of the album on CD and vinyl on April 6, 2018, to be followed the next day with a performance of the album in full at The Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles with members of the 1997-era line-up. In mid-February 2018, The Aquabats played nine dates in the United Kingdom with Army of Freshmen supporting Bowling for Soup on their \"Get Happy!\" tour.
