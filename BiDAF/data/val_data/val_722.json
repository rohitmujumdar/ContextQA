{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 2002, Hitchens wrote a column criticising Sir Alan Duncan after he became the first Conservative MP to come out as gay. Hitchens wrote that as a \"private homosexual,\" Duncan \"needed and deserved the tolerance of those, like me, who think his choice is wrong but believe he had the right to make it.\" However, he continued, by \"asking for open acceptance of his choice as normal,\" he had undermined the position of \"heterosexual marriage\" as the \"ideal and right form of sexual partnership,\" and made a \"gesture of contempt\" to millions of Conservative voters. He now argues that it is futile to express \"conservative\" opinions on homosexuality and same-sex marriage, as to do so merely ensures that one will immediately be accused of bigotry and the \"subjectively defined thoughtcrime\" of homophobia, against which, he argues, it is impossible to defend oneself. For Hitchens, the same-sex marriage debate is a \"Stalingrad\" and a \"diversion\" from the more important and central issue of the general breakdown of marriage in British society, exemplified by the increased prevalence of divorce and single-parent families. In 2016, he wrote a column criticising the outcome of the Northern Irish 'Gay Cake' case, in which the owners of a Belfast bakery were successfully sued by a gay couple for refusing to bake a cake with the words \"support gay marriage\" written in icing. In a later radio discussion, he called the ruling \"outrageously totalitarian,\" and said, \"Where people can be forced to publish things with which they disagree, there is no freedom.\" In November 2017, in response to the sacking of a primary school teacher for accidentally misgendering a transgender pupil, Hitchens wrote a column attacking the transgender rights movement.

as part of the then Mediterranean Fleet of the Royal Navy. Hitchens originally hoped to become a naval officer himself, but an eye defect prevented him from doing so. He was educated at the Leys School and the Oxford College of Further Education before being accepted at the University of York, where he studied Philosophy and Politics and was a member of Alcuin College, graduating in 1973. He later commented that he \"must have been a severe disappointment\" to his parents after making sure he \"would never get into Oxbridge\" by sabotaging his own education, through actions which included being arrested breaking into a government fall-out shelter in Cambridge.", "title": "Peter Hitchens"}
