{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Punk rock bands like Green Day and Rancid were gaining popularity, and riding on this wave of popularity, Smash's singles became radio rock hits. An example of this was the success of The Offspring's first major single release, \"Come Out and Play\", which reached #1 on Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The second single released from the album, \"Self Esteem\", became a radio hit, managing to peak at number 4 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, although it didn't hit number 1 like its prior hit, \"Self Esteem\" was actually more popular and more successful worldwide. The lyrics are about an abusive relationship in which the girl takes advantage of her boyfriend, as he has \"no self-esteem\" to stand up to her. Contrary to popular belief, the song is not autobiographical. In an interview Dexter revealed that it is about one of his old friends. This song was the most successful and most popular of the album's three singles. The third single, \"Gotta Get Away\" was another rock radio hit, although it was not as successful as the previous two singles. The song reached number 6 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. Being the last song written for the album, the lyrics describe a point in Dexter's life when he was suffering from extreme pressure due to the then-upcoming deadline of the album. \"What Happened To You\" is driven by a Jamaican ska beat. A fourth song, \"Bad Habit\", received radio play in some areas, but was never officially released. However, it is often their set opener and is a favorite among fans. The lyrics discuss road rage to the point where the protagonist shoots at the car in front of him. The only cover in the album was \"Killboy Powerhead\", by The Didjits.
