{"paragraphs": [{"context": "The Get Up Kids have had a lasting impact on the music scene, having been cited as inspirations to several prominent bands and artists. Blink-182 bassist and singer Mark Hoppus is a vocal fan, having proposed to his wife to The Get Up Kids song \"I'll Catch You.\" They were also a major influence on the rest of the band, even at their peak popularity around the release of Take Off Your Pants and Jacket. The members of Fall Out Boy cite The Get Up Kids' influence, particularly their album Four Minute Mile. In a 2005 interview with Alternative Press, Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz stated that the band had a huge influence on him and the other members of Fall Out Boy. \"There should be a How To Be a Pop-Punk Kid starter kit with bands like Get Up Kids, so kids would know whose shoulders bands like us are standing on. Fall Out Boy would not be a band if it were not for The Get Up Kids.\" New Jersey based act Midtown has stated in interviews that they were heavily influenced by The Get Up Kids, among other groups. The Early November band members were all fans of, and influenced by, The Get Up Kids. The Early November song \"Baby Blue\" includes the line \"I don't want you to love me anymore\", a direct reference to the Get Up Kids song \"No Love\" both lyrically and melodically. The band Hellogoodbye have been vocal fans of the band and while on tour with Reggie and the Full Effect in 2007, two years after the breakup of The Get Up Kids, Hellogoodbye invited James Dewees and Matt Pryor onstage with them, and proceeded to back them in a cover of The Get Up Kids' song \"Action & Action\". The Canadian post-hardcore band Silverstein has cited the Get Up Kids as a major influence, and covered their song Coming Clean for a split 7\" with August Burns Red in 2013. Claudio Sanchez of Coheed and Cambria cited Something to Write Home About as one of the albums that the band listened to and during the recording of their breakout album In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3. Despite their lasting influence on modern music, the band has attempted to disassociate themselves with many of the bands they inspired. Following the band's reformation, guitarist Jim Suptic undertook an interview with website Drowned in Sound, in which he said, \"The punk scene we came out of and the punk scene now are completely different. It's like glam rock now. We played the Bamboozle fests this year and we felt really out of place... If this is the world we helped create, then I apologise.\" He went on to say they were grateful for the acknowledgements they have received, though explaining \"the problem is most of [the bands they inspired] aren't very good.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What bands did they influence?", "answers": [{"text": "Blink-182 bassist and singer Mark Hoppus is a vocal fan, having proposed to his wife to The Get Up Kids song \"I'll Catch You.\"", "answer_start": 136}, {"text": "The members of Fall Out Boy cite The Get Up Kids' influence, particularly their album Four Minute Mile.", "answer_start": 405}, {"text": "Blink-182 bassist and singer Mark Hoppus is a vocal fan,", "answer_start": 136}, {"text": "The Get Up Kids have had a lasting impact on the music scene, having been cited as inspirations to several prominent bands and artists.", "answer_start": 0}], "id": "C_0f8d20918559435b84d041fdb28694fc_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "The Get Up Kids have had a lasting impact on the music scene, having been cited as inspirations to several prominent bands and artists.", "answer_start": 0}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "Which bands did they influence?", "answers": [{"text": "members of Fall Out Boy cite The Get Up Kids' influence, particularly their album Four Minute Mile.", "answer_start": 409}, {"text": "New Jersey based act Midtown has stated in interviews that they were heavily influenced by The Get Up Kids,", "answer_start": 894}, {"text": "Jacket.
