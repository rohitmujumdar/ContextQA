{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In March 1985, after long negotiations, Pet Shop Boys cut their contractual ties with Bobby O, with a settlement giving Bobby O significant royalties for future sales. Hiring manager Tom Watkins, they signed with the London-based Parlophone label. In April, Tennant left Smash Hits magazine - where he had progressed to the position of deputy editor - and in July, a new single, \"Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)\", was released, reaching number 116 in the UK. The B-side to this single, \"In the Night\", later resurfaced, in a longer remixed version, as the opening track to the duo's first remix album, Disco, in 1986. This version was also used as the theme for the UK television series The Clothes Show. Unperturbed by the low chart position, the band returned to the studio in August to re-record \"West End Girls\" with producer Stephen Hague. Released in October 1985, this new version initially entered the charts at a similarly low position, but began a slow rise so that, by January 1986, it achieved the top spot. It was subsequently number one in the United States, Canada, Finland, Hong Kong, Lebanon, Israel, New Zealand and Norway and sold an estimated 1.5 million copies worldwide. It remains the most-heard Pet Shop Boys song to date. After the success of \"West End Girls\", Pet Shop Boys released a follow-up single, \"Love Comes Quickly\", on 24 February 1986. The single reached number 19 in the UK Singles Chart and was followed by their debut album, Please, on 24 March. In June 1986, the band announced a European tour; however, their plans for a theatrical extravaganza proved to be too expensive and the tour was cancelled. Please started Pet Shop Boys' penchant for choosing one-word album titles, which Neil Tennant has since stated is now a Pet Shop Boys \"signature thing\", akin to e.e. cummings' use of exclusively lower case letters. New versions of their second single, \"Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)\", and the album track \"Suburbia\" were also released in 1986, followed by a remix album, Disco. In September 1986, Pet Shop Boys performed \"Love Comes Quickly\" and \"West End Girls\" at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards in Los Angeles.
