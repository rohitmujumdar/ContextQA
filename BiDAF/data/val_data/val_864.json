{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In \"The Trip\", Kramer admits that a man in a park exposed himself to him when he was a young boy. In \"The Big Salad\" Kramer reveals to Jerry that he grew up in a strict household where he had to be in bed every night by 9:00PM. In \"The Letter\", Kramer tells two art patrons that he ran away from home at age seventeen and stowed away aboard a steamer bound for Sweden. Kramer never completed high school; however, it is made clear in \"The Barber\" that Kramer has a GED. Kramer was estranged for a long period from his mom, Babs Kramer, who works as a restroom matron at an upscale restaurant. Unlike George and Jerry, Kramer's character does not have a well-developed network of family members shown in the sitcom. He is the only main character on the show whose dad never makes an appearance; however, in \"The Chinese Woman\", Kramer mentions that he is the last male member of his family, implying that his father had died. He also mentions in \"The Lip Reader\" that he has or had a deaf cousin, from whom he learned fluent American Sign Language, but when Kramer tries to communicate in ASL, he speaks complete gibberish and cannot correctly translate the ASL he sees others using. He also apparently has no biological children, although he adopted mile 114 of the Arthur Burkhardt Expressway in \"The Pothole\". During an opening discussion, Kramer reveals to Jerry that in 1979 he was struck on the head by a falling air conditioner while walking on the sidewalk. Jerry asks if that was when Kramer lived in Greenwich Village, to which Kramer replies that he cannot remember. This is discussed in the beginning of \"The Little Kicks\". In \"The Strong Box\", it is revealed that Kramer spent a brief time in the Army, although info about this time is \"classified\". In episode three of season one he says he lived in Los Angeles for three months. The character of Kramer was originally based on the real-life Kenny Kramer, a neighbor of co-creator Larry David from New York. However, Michael Richards did not in any way base his performance on the real Kramer, to the point of refusing to meet him. This was later parodied in \"The Pilot\" when the actor that is cast to play him in Jerry and George's sitcom refuses to base the character on the real Cosmo Kramer. At the time of the shooting of the original Seinfeld pilot, \"The Seinfeld Chronicles,\" Kenny Kramer had not yet given consent to use his name, and so Kramer's character was originally known as \"Kessler.\" Larry David was hesitant to use Kenny Kramer's real name because he suspected that Kramer would take advantage of this. David's suspicion turned out to be correct; Kenny Kramer created the \"Kramer Reality Tour\", a New York City bus tour that points out actual locations of events or places featured in Seinfeld. The \"Kramer Reality Tour\" is itself spoofed on Seinfeld in \"The Muffin Tops.\" In the episode, when Kramer's real-life stories are used by Elaine to pad the biography of J. Peterman she was ghostwriting, he develops a reality bus tour called \"The Peterman Reality Tour\" and touts himself as \"The Real J. Peterman,\" even though, as Jerry notes, reality is the last thing Kramer is qualified to give a tour on. Richards' physicality can be seen in his early 1980s appearances on The Tonight Show, the early 1980s ABC sketch comedy show \"Fridays\", and his appearance in the film \"Young Doctors in Love\" where he plays a hit man; a nod to this appears in the \"Air Conditioner\" episode. A storyline running throughout the fifth season is the development of one of Kramer's few successful ideas. Kramer first thinks of the book in \"The Cigar Store Indian\", although he later claims that he first had the idea when skiing. Throughout the season, his quest to get the book published becomes a running gag. Although Elaine is shown as disliking the idea, Mr. Lippman, her boss, likes it, which surprises her. Pendant Publishing (where Elaine and Kramer's then-girlfriend work) decides to publish it in \"The Fire\". In \"The Opposite\", Kramer starts his \"book tour\" with an appearance on Regis and Kathie Lee. By accidentally spitting his coffee over Kathie Lee Gifford (\"All over my Kathie Lee Casuals!\"), his book tour immediately goes down in flames. Also in the episode, as a result of a bizarre chain of events, Elaine inadvertently causes the end of Pendant Publishing and therefore the end of Kramer's book. Nevertheless, the book is mentioned later in the episode \"The Wizard\" where it is revealed that the book is being made into a movie and the money Kramer makes allows him to briefly retire to Florida and run for president of the condo board at Del Boca Vista, Phase 3. The book itself is full of pictures of celebrities' coffee tables, and even had a pair of foldable wooden legs so that it could itself be turned into a coffee table. He also says that he has plans for a coaster to be built into the cover.
