{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Hilson's music is generally R&B, hip hop and pop. Her debut album, In a Perfect World..., consists of a pop/R&B style, with elements of electro music. Many of the album's themes deal with relationships, physical attraction and lovemaking. Hilson said, \"lyrically it's a very vulnerable album. You know, I definitely didn't want to paint myself as perfect on this project. Instead, I wanted it to be something that was very relatable, especially to women\". Her second album, No Boys Allowed, displays a wide variety of styles, including pop, R&B, hip hop, soul, acoustic, electronic and reggae. Hilson describes the album as \"more self-assured. It's a lot more aggressive\". Kristin Macfarlane of The Daily Post noted that the album is \"pure girl power and about being sexually confident, and confident as a woman; not putting up with crap relationships and getting your way\". Hilson sings with \"smooth vocals\". Following the release of her debut album, Sophie Bruce of BBC Music expressed that, \"there's no denying Hilson has a great voice, but it lacks the feisty edge of [Nicole] Scherzinger, [Mary J.] Blige or [Beyonce] Knowles\". Mark Nero of About.com commented, \"Keri's voice, while strong, isn't particularly distinctive or memorable\". Hilson has stated that her musical influences come from her father's side of the family. \"My grandmother would sing in the choir; while my dad--while he was in college--sang and recorded with a quartet. ... it was definitely my dad's Southern side that impacted on me musically\". Hilson's father also introduced her to artists such as Sade, Anita Baker, The Blind Boys of Alabama, Lisa Stansfield, Take 6 and Stevie Wonder. In addition, she cites Michael Jackson, Lauryn Hill and late singer Aaliyah as inspirations.
