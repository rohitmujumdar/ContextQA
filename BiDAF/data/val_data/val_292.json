{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 2012, Reddy decided to return to performing after being buoyed by the warm reception she received when she sang at her sister's 80th birthday party. \"I hadn't heard my voice in 10 years, and when I heard it coming over the speaker, it was like: 'Oh, that's not bad. Maybe I should do that again,'\" Reddy explained in 2013. On 12 July 2012, Reddy returned to the musical stage at Croce's Jazz Bar in San Diego and for a benefit concert for the arts at St. Genevieve High School in Panorama City, a neighborhood of Los Angeles. Reddy also sang a duet (\"You're Just in Love\") with senior choir member Rosalind Smith. Being more in control of her performances also appeals to Reddy, who said, \"I have more leeway in the songs that I choose to sing. I'm not locked into what the record company wants.\" She explained, \"One of the reasons that I'm coming back to singing is because I'm not doing the greatest hits. I'm doing the songs that I always loved. So many are album cuts that never got any airplay, and they're gorgeous songs.\" She also does perform many of her best-known songs, including, \"Angie Baby,\" \"You and Me Against the World\", a medley of \"Delta Dawn\"/\"Ain't No Way to Treat a Lady,\" and \"I Am Woman,\" reasoning on the latter that it's her signature song and one that the audience \"comes to hear.\" She maintains, however, that she still refuses to sing \"Leave Me Alone (Ruby Red Dress)\" because she dislikes the monotony of the repeated chorus. \"They used to have a contest on the radio that you could get two free tickets to Helen Reddy's show if you could tell us how many times she sang 'leave me alone.' I think it was like 42 times,\" she said. Reddy performed at the Paramount nightclub at The Crown & Anchor in Provincetown on 13 October 2013. She performed two nights at Catalina Supper Club, Los Angeles in November 2014, shortly after her 73rd birthday. The following January 2015, Reddy performed two nights at Orleans Hotel Showroom in Las Vegas. Reddy appeared in downtown Los Angeles at the 2017 Women's March on January 21. The march for women's rights and unity following the inauguration of Donald Trump brought out 750,000 people. Reddy was introduced by actress Jamie Lee Curtis and sang an a cappella version of her song, \"I Am Woman\".
