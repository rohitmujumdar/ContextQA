{"paragraphs": [{"context": "During his teenage years, Baldwin followed his stepfather's shadow into the religious life. However, he became dissatisfied with ministry, considering it hypocritical and racist, and ultimately left the church because his father's expectation was that he be a preacher. The difficulties of his life, including his stepfather's abuse, led Baldwin to seek solace in religion. At the age of 14 he attended meetings of the Pentecostal Church and, during a euphoric prayer meeting, he converted and became a junior minister. Before long, at the Fireside Pentecostal Assembly, he was drawing larger crowds than his stepfather had done in his day. At 17, however, Baldwin came to view Christianity as based on false premises and later regarded his time in the pulpit as a way of overcoming his personal crises. Baldwin once visited Elijah Muhammad, leader of the Nation of Islam, who inquired about Baldwin's religious beliefs. He answered, \"I left the church 20 years ago and haven't joined anything since.\" Elijah asked, \"And what are you now?\" Baldwin explained, \"Now? Nothing. I'm a writer. I like doing things alone.\" Still, his church experience significantly shaped his worldview and writing. Baldwin reflected that \"being in the pulpit was like working in the theatre; I was behind the scenes and knew how the illusion was worked.\" Baldwin accused Christianity of reinforcing the system of American slavery by palliating the pangs of oppression and delaying salvation until a promised afterlife. Baldwin praised religion, however, for inspiring some American blacks to defy oppression. He once wrote, \"If the concept of God has any use, it is to make us larger, freer, and more loving. If God can't do that, it's time we got rid of him.\" Baldwin publicly described himself as not religious. A recording of him singing \"Precious Lord, Take My Hand\" a cappella was played at his funeral.
