{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Craddock spent several years out of the music business while working in a cigarette factory and hanging drywall. He soon returned to recording, now as a country singer. He signed with Cartwheel Records in 1969. He soon had his first number one hit with a cover of the Tony Orlando and Dawn pop hit \"Knock Three Times\" in 1971. His version was faster and included Cajun fiddles. The song also reached the top five of the Billboard magazine Hot Country Singles chart that spring, beginning a streak of hits that continued throughout the 1970s. Other hits he had for Cartwheel, all during 1971-1972, included \"Dream Lover\", \"You Better Move On\", \"Ain't Nothin' Shakin' (But the Leaves on The Trees)\", and \"I'm Gonna Knock on Your Door\", were all top 10 hits in 1971 and 1972. In 1973, Craddock signed with ABC Records (later ABC/Dot Records), where he enjoyed his biggest hits. One was \"Sweet Magnolia Blossom\" but his biggest hit, 1974's \"Rub It In\", was also a modest pop hit. Today, several bars from the song are featured in commercials for Glade Plug-In products. Craddock was also credited with doing one of the better covers of Roy Head and the Traits \"Treat Her Right\". In 1975 he released Still Thinkin' 'Bout You. Craddock consistently hit the country top ten in the 1970s and he became one of country music's first male sex symbols, unusually handsome for a male country star of the era and dressed in stage clothes exposing his hairy, muscular chest as he growled his way through rocking numbers and love songs with a stage persona strongly influenced by Elvis Presley. In 1977, he moved to Capitol Records, where he had his last two top 10 hits: \"I Cheated on a Good Woman's Love\" (1978) and \"If I Could Write a Song as Beautiful as You\" (1979). He recorded several more albums for Capitol before leaving the label in 1983.
