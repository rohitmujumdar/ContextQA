{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Kirkpatrick said, \"What takes place in the Security Council more closely resembles a mugging than either a political debate or an effort at problem-solving.\" Still, she finished her term with a certain respect for the normative power of the United Nations as the \"institution whose majorities claim the right to decide--for the world--what is legitimate and what is illegitimate.\" She noted that the United States had increasingly ignored that significance and became increasingly isolated. That was problematic, because \"relative isolation in a body like the United Nations is a sign of impotence,\" especially given its ability to shape international attitudes. She was ambassador to the UN during the September 1, 1983 Soviet shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007, near Moneron Island. It had carried 269 passengers and crew including a sitting congressman, Larry McDonald (D-GA). She played before the Security Council the audio of the electronic intercept of the interceptor pilot during the attack, and the Soviet Union could no longer deny its responsibility for the shootdown. Kirkpatrick was a Board Member of the American Foundation for Resistance International and the National Council to Support the Democracy Movements, intended to help bring down Soviet and East European Communism. Along with Vladimir Bukovsky, Martin Colman and Richard Perle, she worked to organize democratic revolutions against communism. According to Jay Nordlinger, on a visit with American dignitaries, Soviet human rights activist Andrei Sakharov said, \"Kirkpatski, Kirkpatski, which of you is Kirkpatski?\" When others pointed to Kirkpatrick, he said, \"Your name is known in every cell in the Gulag\" because she had named Soviet political prisoners on the floor of the UN. Kirkpatrick said she would serve only one term at the UN and stepped down in April 1985.
