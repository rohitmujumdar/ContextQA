{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In a March 2017 interview with Japan's Roppongi Rocks, frontman Chuck Billy revealed that Testament had begun working on new material for their twelfth studio album, and planned to continue writing in the summer after their U.S. and European tours. Billy also expressed hope that the album would be released in 2018, stating, \"We thought we'd have a record out after two years; it just ended up being four, because the process just... I don't know what happened, but it took forever. So this time, like, you know what? I don't wanna do that again. I told Eric exactly when we were done recording. I said, 'You know what? It's a great record now, but I don't wanna go through what I had to go through to do this again. So why don't we start writing now?' So we decided that when we're not on the road, let's get together and just jam and maybe come up and at least get to that point where we were with this record -- a bunch of ideas and riffs and lyrics.\" In a December 2017 interview with Metal Messiah Radio, Billy stated that Testament will start working on their new album after they finish touring in support of Brotherhood of the Snake in August 2018, hoping not to repeat the four year gaps between their last three albums. He explained, \"If we can get a head start on riffs and ideas, and then hopefully after that, you know, really dig in to put out a record in 2019, sometime.\" Peterson confirmed in a February 2018 interview with RockSverige that he has begun the songwriting process of the album, and added, \"Our plan was to end in August 2018 and maybe get into the studio by the end of 2018 and put the record out in 2019. But, you know, Slayer's announced [their farewell tour] and they want us to be a part of it. I would imagine, if that stuff happens, then things will get pushed back a little bit, but the initial plan is to have it out in 2019. [We're] ready for summer to do all the A markets for festivals and stuff. This summer we're not doing a lot of festivals; we're actually talking about bowing out of a couple to make other things happen with the Slayer farewell thing.\" In support of their twelfth studio album, Testament will reportedly embark on a revamped version of the Clash of the Titans tour with Megadeth, Slayer and Sepultura.
