{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 1981, Contrary to popular notion, Cuneta's first film was not produced by Viva Films but by a production outfit known as Sining Silangan. Director Danny Zialcita was selected to direct the film; part of his job was also to convince the Cuneta household to allow Sharon to jump into acting. Almers De Luna, a member of the group Sharon's Angels, revealed that the Cunetas asked for a P220,000-talent fee, which at the time was a large amount for a newcomer. To the disbelief of Sharon's parents, Sining Silangan agreed to pay the sum without reservation. Cuneta starred in her very first feature film entitled, Dear Heart. She was paired with then Close-Up model and Regal Films' 1980s heartthrob, Gabby Concepcion. Dear Heart was successful and paved the way for future collaborations. Due to the commercial success of Dear Heart, a sequel was made. Since Sining Silangan didn't have the means to create an immediate follow up film, Pablo Cuneta collaborated with Vic Del Rosario and established Viva Films. On November 12, 1981, Viva Films released its first feature film, P.S. I Love You, starring Cuneta and Concepcion. The film was a box office success and was followed by another Sharon-Gabby collaboration, My Only Love (1982). Cuneta was also paired with other leading men, with the likes of William Martinez (in Forgive and Forget), Rowell Santiago (in Cross My Heart and Friends in Love) and Miguel Rodriguez (in To Love Again) from 1982-83, which made her the Ms. RP Movies for the years mentioned. She continued hosting the noontime show, Germspesyal, later called GMA Supershow, with German Moreno. She released albums such as PS I Love You (1981), Sixteen (1982) and Sharon & Love (1983).
