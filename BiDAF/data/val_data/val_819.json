{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 1956 Shockley moved from New Jersey to Mountain View, California to start Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory to live closer to his ailing mother in Palo Alto, California. The company, a division of Beckman Instruments, Inc., was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as Silicon Valley. \"His way\" could generally be summed up as domineering and increasingly paranoid. In one well-known incident, he claimed that a secretary's cut thumb was the result of a malicious act and he demanded lie detector tests to find the culprit, when in reality, the secretary had simply grabbed at a door handle that happened to have an exposed tack on it for the purpose of hanging paper notes on. After he received the Nobel Prize in 1956 his demeanor changed, as evidenced in his increasingly autocratic, erratic and hard-to-please management style. In late 1957, eight of Shockley's researchers, who would come to be known as the \"traitorous eight\", resigned after Shockley decided not to continue research into silicon-based semiconductors. They went on to form Fairchild Semiconductor, a loss from which Shockley Semiconductor never recovered. Over the course of the next 20 years, more than 65 new enterprises would end up having employee connections back to Fairchild. A group of about thirty colleagues who had met on and off since 1956 met again at Stanford in 2002 to reminisce about their time with Shockley and his central role in sparking the information technology revolution. The group's organizer said, \"Shockley is the man who brought silicon to Silicon Valley.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "m", "yesno": "x", "question": "What did Shockley's semiconductor do?", "answers": [{"text": "The company, a division of Beckman Instruments, Inc., was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as Silicon Valley.", "answer_start": 173}, {"text": "was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as Silicon Valley.", "answer_start": 227}, {"text": "Laboratory", "answer_start": 100}, {"text": "The company, a division of Beckman Instruments, Inc., was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as Silicon Valley.", "answer_start": 173}], "id": "C_0735e63bb67b49b9897e540f109ec967_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "The company, a division of Beckman Instruments, Inc., was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as Silicon Valley.", "answer_start": 173}}, {"followup": "m", "yesno": "x", "question": "What year was the semiconductor made?", "answers": [{"text": "1956", "answer_start": 3}, {"text": "1956", "answer_start": 3}, {"text": "In 1956", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "In 1956", "answer_start": 0}], "id": "C_0735e63bb67b49b9897e540f109ec967_0_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "In 1956", "answer_start": 0}}, {"followup": "m", "yesno": "y", "question": "Did he win any awards for this?", "answers": [{"text": "he received the Nobel Prize in 1956", "answer_start": 739}, {"text": "received the Nobel Prize in 1956", "answer_start": 742}, {"text": "Nobel Prize in 1956", "answer_start": 755}], "id": "C_0735e63bb67b49b9897e540f109ec967_0_q#2", "orig_answer": {"text": "Nobel Prize in 1956", "answer_start": 755}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "Who did Shockley work with?", "answers": [{"text": "In late 1957, eight of Shockley's researchers, who would come to be known as the \"traitorous eight\", resigned", "answer_start": 887}, {"text": "about thirty colleagues", "answer_start": 1322}, {"text": "In late 1957, eight of Shockley's researchers, who would come to be known as the \"traitorous eight\",", "answer_start": 887}], "id": "C_0735e63bb67b49b9897e540f109ec967_0_q#3", "orig_answer": {"text": "In late 1957, eight of Shockley's researchers, who would come to be known as the \"traitorous eight\",", "answer_start": 887}}, {"followup": "m", "yesno": "x", "question": "Why were they called that?", "answers": [{"text": "the \"traitorous eight\", resigned after Shockley decided not to continue research into silicon-based semiconductors.
