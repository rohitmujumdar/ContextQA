{"paragraphs": [{"context": "During the winter of 1973, after returning from a short production of Rainbow in New York in Washington, D.C., Meat Loaf was cast in The Rocky Horror Show, playing the parts of Eddie and Dr. Everett Scott. The success of the musical led to the filming of The Rocky Horror Picture Show in which Meat Loaf played only Eddie, a decision he said made the movie not as good as the musical. About the same time, Meat Loaf and Steinman started work on Bat Out of Hell. Meat Loaf convinced Epic Records to shoot videos for four songs, \"Bat Out of Hell\", \"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\", \"You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth\", and \"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad\". He then convinced Lou Adler, the producer of Rocky Horror, to run the \"Paradise\" video as a trailer to the movie. Meat Loaf's final show in New York was Gower Champion's Rockabye Hamlet, a Hamlet musical. It closed two weeks into its initial run. Meat Loaf later returned occasionally to perform \"Hot Patootie - Bless My Soul\" for a special Rocky Horror reunion or convention, and rarely at his own live shows (one performance of which was released in the 1996 Live Around the World CD set). During his recording of the soundtrack for Rocky Horror, Meat Loaf recorded two more songs: \"Stand by Me\" (a Ben E. King cover), and \"Clap Your Hands\". They remained unreleased until 1984, when they appeared as B-sides to the \"Nowhere Fast\" single. In 1976, Meat Loaf recorded lead vocals for Ted Nugent's album Free-for-All when regular Nugent lead vocalist Derek St. Holmes temporarily quit the band. Meat Loaf sang lead on five of the album's nine tracks. As on the \"Stoney & Meatloaf\" album, he was credited as Meatloaf (one word) on the \"Free-for-All\" liner notes.
