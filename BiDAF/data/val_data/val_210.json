{"paragraphs": [{"context": "On September 9, 1971, prisoners at the state penitentiary at Attica, NY, took control of a cell block and seized thirty-nine correctional officers as hostages. After four days of negotiations, Department of Correctional Services Commissioner Russell Oswald agreed to most of the inmates' demands for various reforms but refused to grant complete amnesty to the rioters, with passage out of the country and removal of the prison's superintendent. When negotiations stalled and the hostages appeared to be in imminent danger, Rockefeller ordered New York State Police and national guard troops to restore order and take back the prison on September 13. Thirty nine people died in the assault, including ten of the hostages. An additional eighty people were wounded in what was called \"a turkey shoot\" by state prosecutor Malcolm Bell. A later investigation showed all but three of the deaths were caused by the gunfire of the National Guard and police. The other three were inmates killed by other inmates at the beginning of the riot. Opponents blamed Rockefeller for these deaths in part because of his refusal to go to the prison and negotiate with the inmates, while his supporters, including many conservatives who had often vocally differed with him in the past, defended his actions as being necessary to the preservation of law and order. \"I was trying to do the best I could to save the hostages, save the prisoners, restore order, and preserve our system without undertaking actions which could set a precedent which would go across this country like wildfire,\" Rockefeller later said. In a telephone call with President Nixon, Rockefeller explained the deaths by saying \"that's life.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "Where was the Attica Prison?", "answers": [{"text": "Attica, NY,", "answer_start": 61}, {"text": "Attica, NY,", "answer_start": 61}, {"text": "Attica, NY,", "answer_start": 61}, {"text": "Attica, NY,", "answer_start": 61}, {"text": "On September 9, 1971, prisoners at the state penitentiary at Attica, NY, took control of a cell block and seized thirty-nine correctional officers as hostages.", "answer_start": 0}], "id": "C_286a375eb186460e9398fff28905a402_1_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "On September 9, 1971, prisoners at the state penitentiary at Attica, NY, took control of a cell block and seized thirty-nine correctional officers as hostages.", "answer_start": 0}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "Why did they riot?", "answers": [{"text": "After four days of negotiations, Department of Correctional Services Commissioner Russell Oswald agreed to most of the inmates' demands for various reforms", "answer_start": 160}, {"text": "inmates' demands for various reforms", "answer_start": 279}, {"text": "various reforms but refused to grant complete amnesty to the rioters, with passage out of the country and removal of the prison's superintendent.", "answer_start": 300}, {"text": "the inmates' demands for various reforms but refused to grant complete amnesty to the rioters, with passage out of the country and removal of the prison's superintendent.", "answer_start": 275}], "id": "C_286a375eb186460e9398fff28905a402_1_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "the inmates' demands for various reforms but refused to grant complete amnesty to the rioters, with passage out of the country and removal of the prison's superintendent.", "answer_start": 275}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "How long did the riot last?", "answers": [{"text": "After four days of negotiations,", "answer_start": 160}, {"text": "take back the prison on September 13.", "answer_start": 613}, {"text": "After four days of negotiations,", "answer_start": 160}, {"text": "After four days of negotiations,", "answer_start": 160}, {"text": "Rockefeller ordered New York State Police and national guard troops to restore order and take back the prison on September 13.
