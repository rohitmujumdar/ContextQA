{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 1885, he was deported to Siberia, serving a three-year term. Briefly kept in Tyumen prison awaiting transport further east, he was sent to Kurgan in the custody of two gendarmes (October). He was joined there by Maria, who gave birth to their son Roman in 1886. Moving to Turinsk, the Steres joined a group of revolutionaries in internal exile; Constantin Stere agreed to print copies of a Narodnik magazine, using a hectograph, and was exposed during a raid by authorities. He was swiftly taken to Tobolsk, then shipped down the Irtysh to the place where it met the Ob; he traveled to the village of Sharkala (the northernmost part of Siberia he ever reached) in a Khanty canoe, and was then settled in Beryozovsky District, only to be arrested again and sent back to Tobolsk in the autumn of 1888. He was tried for his activities in Turinsk, based on evidence collected by the Okhrana. While in prison, Stere, who was beginning to distance himself from socialism and proletarian internationalism, argued in front of authorities that mention of his change in attitude was supposed to be kept by the court when passing the verdict. At the time, a physician who examined him noted that he had suffered a nervous breakdown, and had him moved to a prison hospital. According to most accounts, he had attempted suicide (a gesture caused by either the death of one of his brothers, who had himself committed suicide, or by news that the Narodnik leader Lev Tikhomirov had become a supporter of the political establishment). In hospital, Stere stated that: \"Quite a while ago have I begun to remove myself from the influence of political exiles and their tradition. Recent times, filled with major hardships for me, I have decided firmly and sincerely to break with these traditions, as well as with all things <<illegal>> in my past.\" Instead, he became familiar with Neo-Kantian philosophy, expanding on his interest in Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (which he was reading in Beryozovsky District). It was at this time that Stere began writing. In March 1889, the court decided to extend his term of exile by three more years, and relocated him to the village of Serginsk, near Minusinsk. He much later claimed that, while passing through the prison of Krasnoyarsk, he met Vladimir Lenin, the future Bolshevik leader -- this is unlikely, as Lenin passed through the city several years after Stere. His other claim to have met and befriended Jozef Pilsudski, future head of state of Poland (and, at the time, a prominent member of the Polish Socialist Party), was confirmed by Pilsudski himself in 1927 (Stere's novel, In preajma revolutiei, included Pilsudski as a character, under the name Stadnicki).
