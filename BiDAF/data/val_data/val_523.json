{"paragraphs": [{"context": "On February 3, 2003 actress Lana Clarkson died in Spector's mansion (the Pyrenees Castle) in Alhambra, California. Her body was found slumped in a chair with a single gunshot wound to her mouth with broken teeth scattered over the carpet. Spector told Esquire magazine in July 2003 that Clarkson's death was an \"accidental suicide\" and that she \"kissed the gun\". The emergency call from Spector's home, made by Spector's driver, Adriano de Souza, quotes Spector as saying, \"I think I've killed someone\". De Souza added that he saw Spector come out the back door of the house with a gun in his hand. Spector remained free on $1 million bail while awaiting trial, which began on March 19, 2007. Presiding Judge Larry Paul Fidler allowed the proceedings in Los Angeles Superior Court to be televised. On September 26, 2007, Judge Fidler declared a mistrial because of a hung jury (ten to two for conviction). The retrial of Spector for murder in the second degree began on October 20, 2008, with Judge Fidler again presiding; this time it was not televised. Spector was once again represented by attorney Jennifer Lee Barringer. The case went to the jury on March 26, 2009, and 19 days later, on April 13, the jury returned a guilty verdict. Additionally, Spector was found guilty of using a firearm in the commission of a crime, which added four years to the sentence. He was immediately taken into custody and, on May 29, 2009, was sentenced to 19 years to life in the California state prison system.

Additionally, he helped engender the idea of the studio as its own distinct instrument. For these contributions, he is acknowledged as one of the most influential figures in pop music history.", "title": "Phil Spector"}
