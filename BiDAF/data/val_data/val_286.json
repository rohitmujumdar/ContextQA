{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 1986, Carlisle married political operative and film producer Morgan Mason, son of actor James Mason. He made appearances in Carlisle's music videos \"Mad About You\" and \"Heaven Is a Place on Earth\". They have one son, James, who was born in 1992. After the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Carlisle and her family moved to Europe, settling in the south of France. Carlisle and her husband lived between Frejus, a commune in Southern France, India, and the United States. In 2017 the couple moved to Bangkok, Thailand. In a 1990 interview with Spin, Carlisle stated that she was not close with her siblings or parents, saying: \"I want to be close to them. I kind of feel uncomfortable. I think I feel guilty sometimes about my success in some ways.\" During the initial stages of her tenure with the Go-Go's, Carlisle developed a serious addiction to cocaine and alcohol that would span thirty years. Simultaneously, she had also developed an eating disorder, which she said stemmed from media comments regarding her appearance; Carlisle's excessive cocaine use helped keep her weight down. Additionally, Carlisle admitted to using LSD, quaaludes, and MDA regularly as both a teenager and adult. In a 2017 interview, she told The Guardian that she \"couldn't believe she wasn't dead.\" After a three-day-long cocaine binge in 2005, Carlisle says she looked at herself in the mirror and \"didn't see a light or a soul\" in her eyes: \"I just thought, 'I know I don't look like myself anymore.'\" The same morning, she had an auditory hallucination telling her she would be found dead in a hotel room if she did not stop using drugs. The incident jarred Carlisle into seeking sobriety, and she has been sober since 2005. She told The Sydney Morning Herald in 2014: \"I don't smoke anymore, I don't drink any more and I don't do drugs any more. I am very much into my Buddhism. I found turning 40 a real passage in time for me.\" Carlisle states in her autobiography Lips Unsealed: A Memoir that she has practiced Nichiren Buddhism as a member of the Soka Gakkai International since 2002, and she often mentions in press interviews that she chants Nam Myoho Renge Kyo daily. She has also credited the practice with helping her maintain sobriety.
