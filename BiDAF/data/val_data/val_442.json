{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW), Cuntapay, using the name B-Boy, joined the Hi V faction, with Messiah and The Backseat Boys, managed by Dewey Donovan. On April 12, 2003, B-Boy defeated Deranged, Lil Cholo, Jay Briscoe and Sonjay Dutt to win the Best of the Best tournament. On July 20, Hi V turned on CZW owner John Zandig, leading to the rest of the roster chasing them out of the building. This allowed the Hi V members to take a short hiatus from CZW, and B-Boy returned on the show of October 11, Uprising, defeating Homicide. He continued working regularly throughout the end of 2003 and 2004, gaining numerous title matches, but failing to win them. On July 10, 2004, B-Boy competed in the fourth annual Best of the Best tournament in an attempt to win it for the second consecutive time, but lost to Roderick Strong in the quarter-finals. After another short hiatus from CZW, B-Boy defeated Dan Maff on December 11 to win the Xtreme Strong Style Tournament. This earned him a match that night against the CZW Iron Man Champion, Chris Hero, who he then defeated to win the championship. After successful defenses against Kaos, B-Boy lost the championship to Frankie The Mobster on February 5, 2005 at Only the Strong: Scarred for Life. On April 2, 2005, B-Boy unsuccessfully challenged Ruckus for the CZW World Heavyweight Championship, and on May 14, he competed in the fifth Best of the Best tournament, making it to the finals, where he lost to Mike Quackenbush in a four-way match. On August 13, B-Boy lost a Loser Leaves Town match to Nate Webb, although he returned just under a month later on September 10, at the Chri$ Ca$h Memorial Show. After this, he competed only sporadically for CZW, making an appearance at the 2006 Chri$ Ca$h Memorial Show, and then, later that night, unsuccessfully challenging LuFisto for the CZW Iron Man Championship. He also competed in the seventh Best of the Best tournament on July 14, 2007, defeating Cheech, Ricochet, Brandon Thomaselli and Jigsaw en route to the final, where he lost to Joker. On January 30, 2010, at High Stakes 4 - Sky's the Limit B-Boy won the CZW World Heavyweight Championship, by defeating the previous champion Drake Younger. He held the championship for two weeks, before losing it to Jon Moxley on February 13. B-Boy announced on his Twitter that he would be returning to CZW to face AR Fox. Later, it was announced that B-Boy would be facing Jonathan Gresham at Proving Grounds.
