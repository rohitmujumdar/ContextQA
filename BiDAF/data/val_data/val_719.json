{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Newly contracted to Bad Boy Records, Evans was consulted by executive producer Combs to contribute backing vocals and writing skills to Mary J. Blige's My Life (1994) and Usher's self-titled debut album (1994) prior to starting work on her debut studio album Faith. Released on August 29, 1995, in North America, the album was a main collaboration with Bad Boy's main producers, The Hitmen, including Chucky Thompson and Combs, but it also resulted in recordings with Poke & Tone and Herb Middleton. Faith became a success based on the singles \"You Used to Love Me\" and \"Soon as I Get Home\". The album was eventually certified platinum with 1.5 million copies sold, according to RIAA. A year before, on August 4, 1994, Evans married rapper and label mate Christopher \"The Notorious B.I.G.\" Wallace, after having met him at a Bad Boy photo shoot. The couple had one child together, Christopher Jordan Wallace, born October 29, 1996, but the marriage was turbulent as Wallace reportedly had several affairs during their union, including relationships with fellow rappers Lil' Kim and Charli Baltimore. Additionally, it led to Evans' involvement in the East Coast-West Coast hip hop rivalry which dominated the rap music news at the time and ended with Wallace's murder in a yet-to-be-solved drive-by shooting in Los Angeles, California in March 1997. During early 1997, after her separation from Wallace, but before his death, Evans' friend Missy Elliott introduced her to record company executive Todd Russaw. Faith began dating Russaw during her and Wallace's separation and after Wallace died, Evans became pregnant by Russaw. The couple had their first son Joshua on June 8, 1998. During the summer of 1998, Evans and Russaw were married, and on March 22, 2007, they had their second son Ryder Evan Russaw. After Biggie's murder on March 9, 1997, Combs helped Evans produce her tribute song named \"I'll Be Missing You\", based on the melody of The Police's 1983 single \"Every Breath You Take\". The song, which featured Combs, Evans, and all-male group 112, became a worldwide number-one success and debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart during 1997, scoring that for eleven weeks. It eventually won Puffy and Evans the 1998 Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. The next year, she received another two Grammy nominations for \"Heartbreak Hotel\", a collaboration with singers Whitney Houston and Kelly Price, that scored number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Two years in the making, Evans' second studio album, Keep the Faith, was released in October 1998. Almost entirely written and produced by her, Evans considered the album difficult to complete as she had initially felt discouraged about the progress at first. Upon its release, however, the album earned generally positive reviews by music critics, with Allmusic noting it \"without a doubt a highlight of 1990s soul-pop music\". Also enjoying commercial success, it eventually went platinum and produced the top ten singles \"Love Like This\" and \"All Night Long\" (released March 30, 1999) prompting Evans to start an 18-city theater tour with Dru Hill and Total the following year.
