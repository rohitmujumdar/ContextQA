{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In December 1982, Mushroom released a medley of Skyhooks songs as \"Hooked on Hooks\" which peaked at #21. Demands for the \"classic\" line-up of the band--Macainsh, Bob Starkie, Strachan, Strauks and Symons--to reform were successful and on 23 April 1983, they started the Living in the 80's Tour. Support acts for the first concert included The Church, Mental as Anything, The Party Boys, The Sunnyboys, and Midnight Oil--who acknowledged, \"Hooks were the only Australian band they would let top the bill above them\". This tour was released on LP as Live in the 80's. A one-off reunion concert took place in October 1984, and in 1990 the band finally recorded new material, including \"Jukebox in Siberia\", released in September, which peaked at the top of the ARIA Singles Charts for two weeks. In November, The Latest and Greatest, a compilation album, was released, which peaked at #4 on the ARIA Albums Charts. The tracks were taken from Skyhooks' first four studio albums along with two recent singles, \"Jukebox In Siberia\" and the uncharted \"Tall Timber\". In 1992, Skyhooks were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame, while their manager, Gudunski, and record label, Mushroom Records, received a 'Special Achievement Award'. Producer of their first three albums, Wilson, had been inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1989 as an individual and again as a member of Daddy Cool in 2006. The final release of new Skyhooks material came in June 1999 when a twin-CD, Skyhooks: The Collection, was issued. Disc one contained a greatest hits package, very similar to \"The Latest and Greatest\", with additional tracks. Disc two is referred to by fans as \"The Lost Album\", with previously unreleased songs from their 1990 and 1994 recording sessions.
