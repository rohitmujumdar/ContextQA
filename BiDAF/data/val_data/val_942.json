{"paragraphs": [{"context": "The 1992 album Coming Home incorporated R&B influences and was a change in musical direction from the more traditional Cantopop fare of her earlier albums. One song by her of this time was \"Fragile Woman\", a cover of a Japanese song \"Rouge\" originally composed by Miyuki Nakajima and sung by Naomi Chiaki. (Thanks to Wong's cover, this 1972 song-in different language versions-would in the early 1990s become a huge regional hit in Thailand, Vietnam and the rest of Southeast Asia and even Turkey; the most popular English version was titled \"Broken-Hearted Woman\".) Coming Home also included her first English-language number, \"Kisses in the Wind\". Wong stated in a 1994 concert that she very much liked this song, after which various websites listed it as her personal favourite; however, in a 1998 CNN interview she declined to name one favourite song, saying that there were too many, and in 2003 she stated that she no longer liked her old songs. The cover for Coming Home prominently shows the name \"Faye\", and from then on she changed her stage name back to \"Wang Fei\" (Wang Fei ). In 1992-93 she also starred in TVB shows such as File of Justice II (Yi Hao Huang Ting II) and Legendary Ranger (Yuan Zhen Xia ). In 1993, she wrote the Mandarin lyrics for her ballad \"No Regrets\" (Zhi Mi Bu Hui ) which led many to praise her as a gifted lyricist. In February, it became the title track to her album No Regrets. No Regrets features soft contemporary numbers, a few dance tracks and two versions of the title ballad: Wong's Mandarin version, and a Cantonese version (lyrics by Chen Shao Qi).
