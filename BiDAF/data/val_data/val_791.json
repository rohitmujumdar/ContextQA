The same year, she married her third husband, Brad Thompson, Clint Black's bus driver. Watch Me, her third album, was released on RCA's newest label, BNA Records; it contained the number-one single, \"What Part of No.\" Watch Me also was certified platinum, making Morgan the first female country artist to have three albums in a row to be certified platinum. Morgan's romantic life gained tabloid attention with Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman. In 1994 she was voted \"Female Vocalist of the Year\" by the fans in TNN's Music City News Awards. She would earn this honor again in 1996, 1997 and 1998. Morgan also appeared on Frank Sinatra's Duets II album, singing a version of \"How Do You Keep the Music Playing\" intertwined with Sinatra's \"My Funny Valentine.\" Morgan's Greatest Hits album, which produced her third and, to date, last number-one single in the song \"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\", was released in 1995. The next year, Morgan was featured on the Beach Boys' now out-of-print album, Stars and Stripes Vol. 1, performing a cover of their 1964 hit, \"Don't Worry Baby.\" The Beach Boys provided the harmonies and backing vocals.
