{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 1952, while still working for Northcutt Ely, Stevens volunteered for the presidential campaign of Dwight D. Eisenhower, writing position papers for the campaign on western water law and lands. By the time Eisenhower won the election that November, Stevens had acquired contacts who told him, \"We want you to come over to Interior.\" Stevens left his job with Ely, but a job in the Eisenhower administration didn't come through as a result of a temporary hiring freeze instituted by Eisenhower in an effort to reduce spending. Instead, Stevens was offered a job with the Fairbanks, Alaska, law firm of Emil Usibelli's Alaska attorney, Charles Clasby, whose firm--Collins and Clasby--had just lost one of its attorneys. Stevens and his wife had met and liked both Usibelli and Clasby, and decided to make the move. Loading up their 1947 Buick and traveling on a $600 loan from Clasby, they drove across country from Washington, D.C., and up the Alaska Highway in the dead of winter, arriving in Fairbanks in February 1953. Stevens later recalled kidding Gov. Walter Hickel about the loan. \"He likes to say that he came to Alaska with 38 cents in his pocket,\" he said of Hickel. \"I came $600 in debt.\" Ann Stevens recalled in 1968 that they made the move to Alaska \"on a six-month trial basis.\" In Fairbanks, Stevens cultivated the city's Republican establishment. He befriended conservative newspaper publisher C.W. Snedden, who had purchased the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner in 1950. Snedden's wife Helen later recalled that her husband and Stevens were \"like father and son.\" \"The only problem Ted had was that he had a temper,\" she told a reporter in 1994, crediting her husband with helping to steady Stevens \"like you would do with your children\" and with teaching Stevens the art of diplomacy.
