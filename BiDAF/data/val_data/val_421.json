{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Academically, Rose graduated from University of Michigan in Mass Communications. Rose got his first broadcasting experience as a courtside reporter for TNT during the 2006 playoffs after the Knicks were eliminated. Upon the Suns' elimination from the 2007 NBA Playoffs, he became a consistent commentator for ESPN giving regular insider perspective on the remaining playoff games from both a player's and analyst's perspective. Since 2007, Rose has worked at ABC/ESPN, first as an analyst on SportsCenter and in 2012 he became one of the hosts for NBA Countdown. Rose has also worked on ESPN's Grantland. He currently co-hosts Jalen and Jacoby, a national, US, sports radio show on ESPN Radio, with David Jacoby that started in September 2015. Rose is the owner of Three Tier Entertainment, an independent, Los Angeles based management and production company. Created in 2007, Three Tier Entertainment develops television and film projects and also manages talent including directors, actors and screenplay writers. The March 13, 2011 airing of the documentary The Fab Five, which Rose produced, sparked controversy that led to a series of media exchanges between members of the press, Michigan Wolverines men's basketball players and Duke Blue Devils men's basketball players in forums such as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. The Fab Five earned a 2.1 rating to become ESPN's highest rated documentary, according to the Nielsen Company. Rose released his first book Got to Give the People What They Want about his personal life story in October 2015. It is a New York Times Bestseller and made the list of Michigan Notable Books from 2016.
