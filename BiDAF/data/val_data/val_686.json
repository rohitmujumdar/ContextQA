{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Ludacris promptly completed his next album, Word of Mouf and released it at the end of 2001. The video for the lead single, \"Rollout (My Business)\", was nominated for a 2002 Grammy Award, and Ludacris performed it live at the awards' pre-show. He released singles \"Saturday (Oooh Oooh)\" with Sleepy Brown, \"Move Bitch\" with Mystikal and I-20, and \"Area Codes\" with Nate Dogg. During the spring of 2003, Ludacris returned to the music scene after a brief hiatus with a new single, \"Act a Fool\", from the 2 Fast 2 Furious soundtrack. At around the same time, he released the lead single from his album Chicken-n-Beer, called \"P-Poppin\" (short for \"Pussy Poppin'\"). Neither of his new singles were as well received by either the urban or pop audiences as his previous songs had been, and both music videos received only limited airplay. Chicken-N-Beer opened strongly, but without a popular single, the album fell quickly. Guest appearances include Playaz Circle, Chingy, Snoop Dogg, 8Ball & MJG, Lil' Flip, I-20, Lil Fate, and Shawnna. In the fall of 2003, Ludacris rebounded with his next single, \"Stand Up\", which appeared on both Chicken-n-Beer as well as the soundtrack for the teen hip hop/dance movie, You Got Served. Produced by Kanye West, \"Stand Up\" went on to become one of Ludacris' biggest mainstream hits to date, hitting the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 garnering heavy airplay on mainstream pop, rhythmic, and urban radio stations, as well as on MTV, MTV2, and BET. Ludacris was sued by a New Jersey group called I.O.F. who claimed that \"Stand Up\" used a hook from one of their songs, but in June 2006, a jury found that the song did not violate copyrights. \"I hope the plaintiffs enjoyed their 15 minutes of fame,\" Ludacris said after the verdict. The album's next single, \"Splash Waterfalls\", was released in early 2004. A huge pop hit (despite its steamy video and explicit, adult-oriented lyrical content and themes), it subsequently became a success at urban radio and BET, and is the only time he has produced two consecutive top 10 singles from a solo album, except for Release Therapy (an unedited version of the video could only be viewed on BET's Uncut program). It was Ludacris' most sexual video yet, an R&B remix that featured Raphael Saadiq and sampled Tony! Toni! Tone!'s \"Whatever You Want\". Ludacris received his first Grammy Award with Usher and Lil Jon for their hit single \"Yeah!\". Ludacris next released \"Blow It Out\", which was accompanied by a low-budget music video.
