{"paragraphs": [{"context": "After the success of Parachutes, Coldplay returned to the studio in September 2001 to begin work on their second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, once again with Ken Nelson producing. Since the band had never stayed in London before, they had trouble focusing. They decided to relocate in Liverpool, where they recorded some of the songs on Parachutes. Once there, vocalist Chris Martin said that they became obsessed with recording. \"In My Place\" was the first song recorded for the album. The band released it as the album's lead single because it was the track that made them want to record a second album, following a \"strange period of not really knowing what we were doing\" three months after the success of Parachutes. According to Martin \"one thing kept us going: recording 'In My Place'. Then other songs started coming.\" The band wrote more than 20 songs for the album. Some of their new material, including \"In My Place\" and \"Animals\", was played live while the band was still touring Parachutes. The album's title was revealed through a post on the band's official website. The album was released in August 2002 and spawned several popular singles, including \"In My Place\", \"Clocks\", and the ballad \"The Scientist\". The latter was inspired by George Harrison's \"All Things Must Pass\", which was released in 1970. Coldplay toured from June 2002 to September 2003 for the A Rush of Blood to the Head Tour. They visited five continents, including co-headlining festival dates at Glastonbury Festival, V2003 and Rock Werchter. Many concerts showcased elaborate lighting and individualised screens reminiscent of U2's Elevation Tour and Nine Inch Nails' Fragility Tour. During the extended tour, Coldplay recorded a live DVD and CD, Live 2003, at Sydney's Hordern Pavilion. At the 2003 Brit Awards held at Earls Court, London, Coldplay received awards for Best British Group, and Best British Album. On 28 August 2003, Coldplay performed \"The Scientist\" at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City, and won three awards. In December 2003, readers of Rolling Stone chose Coldplay as the best artist and the best band of the year. At that time the band covered The Pretenders' 1983 song \"2000 Miles\" (which was made available for download on their official website). \"2000 Miles\" was the top selling UK download that year, with proceeds from the sales donated to Future Forests and Stop Handgun Violence campaigns. A Rush of Blood to the Head won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album at the 2003 Grammy Awards. At the 2004 Grammy Awards, Coldplay earned Record of the Year for \"Clocks\".
