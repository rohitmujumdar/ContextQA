{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In early 2002, Vissi starred in the musical Mala - I Mousiki Tou Anemou, based on a true love story that took place during World War II in Auschwitz, between Mala Zimetbaum and Edward Galinski. The play, which was staged at Pallas Theatre in Athens, it was written by Karvelas, directed by Giannis Kakleas and was accompanied by a symphony orchestra conducted by Giorgos Niarhos. Mala premiered on 19 January. The production and Vissi's performance was received tepidly by critics and its commercial performance was mediocre. The musical was shown on Mega Channel a year later. An album containing the songs performed at the play was also released and charted, reaching gold status in Greece and platinum in Cyprus. In late 2002, Vissi released the album Chi, which was produced by George De Angelis. Shortly after, the album was featured on CNN's Music Room, where they talked about how the album reached number one in Greece. The album quickly reached number one on the IFPI charts, and was certified 2x platinum. In the winter of 2002-2003, she was working at \"Fever\" club in Athens, performing with Yiannis Parios. In May 2003, Vissi performed with Nikos Karvelas and Irini Merkouri at \"Boom\" in Thessaloniki, Greece. On 15 July 2003, Vissi gave a concert at \"A Plaz Voulas/Apollonies Aktes\", with special guest star Nikos Karvelas. In September 2003, Vissi gave another concert in Cyprus, at the Tzirion Stadium in Limassol, to celebrate her 30-year-old career. At the same year, she was awarded with a prize for her whole contribution from the Cyprus Paralympic Organization, while a square in Larnaca was named after her. She also met and talked with the president of the Republic of Cyprus, in the Presidential Palace, in Nicosia. Just before 2004, on 5 December 2003, Vissi released the double album Paraksenes Eikones which went 2x platinum in six months. This was Vissi's first album since 1981's Anna Vissi that included songs written by other composers besides Nikos Karvelas. The album produced many hits. To promote the album, she started appearing at \"Diogenis Studio\" for the winter season 2003-2004, with Konstantinos Christoforou, Nino and girl band Hi-5.
