{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Martin was in an on-off relationship with Mexican TV host Rebecca de Alba for more than 14 years. The pair had spoken of starting a family together, and Martin had at one point considered proposing to her. In August 2008, Martin became the father of twin boys, Matteo and Valentino, born by a surrogate mother. After the success of \"Livin' la Vida Loca,\" Martin's personal life became a subject of interest due to his large gay following, and he was questioned about his sexual orientation. In a December 2000 interview with The Mirror, Martin was asked to comment on the rumors surrounding his sexuality. He replied: \"I don't think I should have to tell anyone if I am gay or not, or who I've slept with or not.\" On March 29, 2010, Martin publicly acknowledged his homosexuality in a post on his official website, stating: \"I am proud to say that I am a fortunate homosexual man. I am very blessed to be who I am.\" Martin said that \"these years in silence and reflection made me stronger and reminded me that acceptance has to come from within, and that this kind of truth gives me the power to conquer emotions I didn't even know existed.\" In 2010, prior to Martin coming out, Barbara Walters expressed some regret for pushing Martin in a 2000 interview to admit if he was gay. The Toronto Star quoted her as saying, \"When I think back on it now, I feel it was an inappropriate question.\" Martin announced on The Oprah Winfrey Show that he was in a relationship. In 2011, during his acceptance speech of the Vito Russo Award at the 22nd GLAAD Media Awards, Martin publicly thanked his boyfriend, Carlos Gonzalez Abella, an economist. His relationship with Gonzalez Abella ended in January 2014. Martin has also expressed support for same-sex marriage in an interview on Larry King Live. Ricky Martin delivered a speech at the United Nations Homophobia Conference on November 12, 2012. Beginning April 2016, he started dating Syrian Swedish painter Jwan Yosef. The two announced their engagement on 16 November 2016, while on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. In January 2018, Martin announced that he and Yosef are married.
