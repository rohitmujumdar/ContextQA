{"paragraphs": [{"context": "On May 10, 2012, Cook performed a new song entitled \"The Last Song I'll Write for You\" on the eleventh season of American Idol. Before the performance, Cook confirmed to Shirley Halperin of the Hollywood Reporter that he is without a recording contract, having departed from RCA, and is self-releasing \"The Last Song I'll Write for You\". On April 30, 2013, Cook released a new single, \"Laying Me Low\", through XIX Recordings, the record label of American Idol creator Simon Fuller, although Cook shortly departed from Fuller's label. Cook co-penned country music singer David Nail's 2014 single, \"Kiss You Tonight\" from his album I'm a Fire. On November 17, 2014, a new single, \"Wait For Me\", was released. On March 24, 2015, it was announced that Cook had signed a publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music. Cook's move to Nashville saw his newfound role as producer of his fourth album, often citing his move as the source of creativity. He worked with previous songwriters like Zac Maloy, Kevin Griffin, David Hodges, and Andy Skib (who also contributed as engineer). Cook also collaborated with Jerry Flowers (Keith Urban's bass guitarist), Earth to Andy members Andy Waldeck and Chris Reardon (with Reardon also serving as co-producer on one track - Laying Me Low), local Nashville writers Blair Daly and Chad Carlson, former bandmate Devin Bronson, and Steven Miller. The album's title Digital Vein and track listing was announced on June 23, 2015, with \"Criminals\" being the first official single from the album released on July 31, 2015. Digital Vein was released on September 18, 2015 through Cook's own independent label, Analog Heart Music. Cook promoted the album on the Digital Vein Tour throughout late 2015 and early 2016. The first half of the tour, with opening act Andrew Ripp, consisted of 33 shows in 24 states, beginning on September 30, 2015 in Phoenix, Arizona and ending on November 21, 2015 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In this tour, Daniel Damico replaced Andy Skib and Devin Bronson as the lead guitarist and keyboardist, drummer Adam Reidelbach replaced Nick Adams, and Andy Wildrick replaced Monty Anderson as the bass guitarist. His second single \"Broken Windows\" was released on February 22, 2016 and coincided with the second half of the tour. Featuring opening act Tony Lucca, the run consisted of 18 shows in 14 states, beginning on February 23, 2016 in Chattanooga, Tennessee and ending on March 19, 2016 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
