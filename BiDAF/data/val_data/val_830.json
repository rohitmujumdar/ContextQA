The song, which featured additional vocals by Missy Elliott and Sandy \"Pepa\" Denton of Salt-n-Pepa fame, went to #1 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and peaked at #37 on the Hot 100. Sullivan's debut album Fearless was released on September 23, 2008. She wrote every song and served as the album's executive producer alongside Missy Elliott, Salaam Remi and Peter Edge. The album received production from Elliott, Remi, Stargate, Carvin & Ivan, Jack Splash, and Fisticuffs. Fearless debuted at #1 on the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums and at #6 on the Billboard 200. Sullivan followed her successful debut single with the release of the second single from Fearless, \"Bust Your Windows\", which reached #4 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and #31 on the Hot 100, becoming her most successful single on that chart to date. \"Bust Your Windows\" appeared on the debut episode of the Fox hit television show Glee and was also nominated for a Grammy for Best R&B Song. In 2014, Stevie Wonder claimed he considered \"Bust Your Windows\" a classic song. \"Lions, Tigers & Bears\" was released as the album's third single in December 2008. It scored her third consecutive top ten on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, reaching #10, and garnered some mainstream success by reaching #74 on the Hot 100. Sullivan later pursued success in the UK when she released \"Dream Big\" as her first official UK single in February 2009, though it failed to chart there. The song was later released as the fourth US single from the album in April 2009, but also failed to chart there. The album's fifth and final single, \"In Love with Another Man\", was released in August 2009 and was only moderately successful by reaching #37 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. A sixth single, \"Switch!\", was set to be released in November 2009, though its release was later cancelled. The album received Gold certification by the RIAA, and has sold more than 510,000 copies in the United States so far. Sullivan was featured on a song entitled \"Smoking Gun\" with Jadakiss on his 2009 album The Last Kiss. She was also a supporting act for R&B singer Maxwell on his highly successful 2008 U.S. tour and was the opening act for Ne-Yo's 2009 Year of the Gentleman Tour. She additionally appeared on Ace Hood's second album, Ruthless, on the song \"Champion\". She went on to headline a few dates with Ryan Leslie, before participating in the Essence Music Festival in June 2009. That same year, Sullivan appeared in commercials for Cotton Incorporated. Additionally, Sullivan made a guest appearance on Snoop Dogg's tenth studio album Malice n Wonderland on the song \"Different Languages\".
