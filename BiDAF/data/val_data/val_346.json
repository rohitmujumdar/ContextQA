{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Anderson was a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, a bi-partisan group with the stated goal of \"making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets\". The Coalition was co-chaired by Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Anderson restructured Salt Lake City's criminal justice system and, after reviewing the peer-reviewed literature indicating that DARE is ineffective in reducing drug use, discontinued the DARE program in Salt Lake City schools. Instead, he supported the implementation of other programs -- ATLAS and ATHENA -- that have demonstrated some success. He called for an end to the failed \"war on drugs\" and for better drug prevention education, the implementation of harm reduction policies, and the availability of substance abuse treatment on demand. He successfully lobbied President Clinton to grant a commutation of a lengthy prison sentence imposed on a Salt Lake City man who had already served several years in a federal penitentiary for his first and only conviction for violating drug laws. In 2000, Anderson asked the Salt Lake City Police Department to end its participation in the DARE program. He told DARE officials: \"I think your organization has been an absolute fraud on the people of this country... For you to continue taking precious drug-prevention dollars when we have such a serious and, in some instances, growing addiction problem is unconscionable.\" Instead of pushing for more minor offenders to be sent to jail or prison, Anderson constructed innovative restorative justice programs, which earned him a nomination for a second World Leadership Award. He implemented reforms to ensure that mental health courts would channel mentally ill criminals into mandatory treatment programs rather than putting them behind bars. People arrested on drug charges, or for prostitution or the solicitation of prostitutes (as well as several other types of offenses), were sent through a comprehensive course of counselling rather than automatically being handed criminal convictions and custodial sentences. The results were better, and the costs far lower, than with the traditional retributive approach.
