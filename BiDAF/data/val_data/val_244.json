{"paragraphs": [{"context": "On April 18, 1977, Carter delivered a televised speech declaring that the U.S. energy crisis during the 1970s was the moral equivalent of war. He encouraged energy conservation by all U.S. citizens and installed solar water heating panels on the White House. He wore sweaters to offset turning up the heat in the White House. On August 4, 1977, Carter signed the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, forming the Department of Energy, the first new cabinet position in eleven years. During the signing ceremony, Carter cited the \"impending crisis of energy shortages\" with causing the necessity of the legislation. At the start of a September 29, 1977 news conference, under the impression he had not come across well in addressing energy during his prior press session, Carter stated that the House of Representatives had \"adopted almost all\" of the energy proposal he had made five months prior and called the compromise \"a turning point in establishing a comprehensive energy program.\" The following month, on October 13, Carter stated he believed in the Senate's ability to pass the energy reform bill and identified energy as \"the most important domestic issue that we will face while I am in office.\" On January 12, 1978, during a press conference, Carter said the continued discussions about his energy reform proposal had \"been long and divisive and arduous\" as well as hindering to national issues that needed to be addressed with the implementation of the law. In an April 11, 1978 news conference, Carter said his biggest surprise \"in the nature of a disappointment\" since becoming president was the difficulty Congress had in passing legislation, citing the energy reform bill in particular: \"I never dreamed a year ago in April when I proposed this matter to the Congress that a year later it still would not be resolved.\" On March 1, 1979, Carter submitted a standby gasoline rationing plan per the request of Congress. Carter delivered an address stressing the urgency of energy conservation on April 5. During an April 30 news conference, Carter said it was \"imperative\" that the House commerce committee approve the standby gasoline rationing plan and called on Congress to pass the several other standby energy conservation plans he had proposed. On July 15, 1979, Carter delivered a nationally televised address in which he identified what he believed to be a \"crisis of confidence\" among the American people, under the advisement of pollster Pat Caddell who believed Americans faced a crisis in confidence from events of the 1960s and 1970s prior to Carter taking office. The address would be cited as Carter's \"malaise\" speech, memorable for mixed reactions and his use of rhetoric. The speech's negative reception came from a view that Carter did not state efforts on his own part to address the energy crisis and was too reliant on Americans.
