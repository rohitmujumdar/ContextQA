{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Brando earned a reputation as a 'bad boy' for his public outbursts and antics. According to Los Angeles magazine, \"Brando was rock and roll before anybody knew what rock and roll was.\" His behavior during the filming of Mutiny on the Bounty (1962) seemed to bolster his reputation as a difficult star. He was blamed for a change in director and a runaway budget, though he disclaimed responsibility for either. On June 12, 1973, Brando broke paparazzo Ron Galella's jaw. Galella had followed Brando, who was accompanied by talk show host Dick Cavett, after a taping of The Dick Cavett Show in New York City. He reportedly paid a $40,000 out-of-court settlement and suffered an infected hand as a result. Galella wore a football helmet the next time he photographed Brando at a gala benefiting the American Indians Development Association. The filming of Mutiny on the Bounty affected Brando's life in a profound way, as he fell in love with Tahiti and its people. He bought a 12-island atoll, Tetiaroa, and in 1970 hired an award-winning young Los Angeles architect, Bernard Judge, to build his home and natural village there without despoiling the environment. An environmental laboratory protecting sea birds and turtles was established and student groups were welcomed there for many years. Tragically, the 1983 hurricane destroyed many of the structures including his resort. A hotel using Brando's name, The Brando Resort was officially opened to the public in 2014. Brando was an active ham radio operator, with the call signs KE6PZH and FO5GJ (the latter from his island). He was listed in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) records as Martin Brandeaux to preserve his privacy. In the A&E Biography episode on Brando, biographer Peter Manso comments, \"On the one hand, being a celebrity allowed Marlon to take his revenge on the world that had so deeply hurt him, so deeply scarred him. On the other hand he hated it because he knew it was false and ephemeral.\" In the same program another biographer, David Thomson, relates, \"Many, many people who worked with him, and came to work with him with the best intentions, went away in despair saying he's a spoiled kid. It has to be done his way or he goes away with some vast story about how he was wronged, he was offended, and I think that fits with the psychological pattern that he was a wronged kid.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What was Brando's lifestyle like?", "answers": [{"text": "Brando earned a reputation as a 'bad boy' for his public outbursts and antics.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Brando was rock and roll before anybody knew what rock and roll was.", "answer_start": 115}, {"text": "Brando earned a reputation as a 'bad boy' for his public outbursts and antics.
