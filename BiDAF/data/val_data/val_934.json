{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Cruz was featured on Tinchy Stryder's breakout single \"Take Me Back\" which peaked at No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart. According to Cruz's official Myspace blog, as of 1 January 2009, Rokstarr Music London changed its name to Rokstarr Entertainment Division, abbreviated to R.E.D Inc. During 2009, he worked on his follow-up album entitled Rokstarr. It was released on 12 October through R.E.D Inc./Island Records and is written and produced by Cruz, with co-writes and co-productions predominantly with UK producer Fraser T Smith. The album's lead single \"Break Your Heart\" was released on 14 September and reached number one in the UK, where it stayed for three weeks. In the US it went directly from number 53 to number one, breaking the record for the largest leap of a debut single. At the 2010 Brit Awards, \"Break Your Heart\" was nominated for Best British Single. The success of the song attracted the attention of David Massey and Daniel Werner from Mercury/Island Def Jam who were excited and aggressive about releasing \"Break Your Heart\" in the United States on their label. According to Cruz's manager Jamie Binns, the relationship with Monte Lipman at Universal Republic had \"gone a bit quiet\" by this point and as Taio wanted to be with the label that was most enthusiastic about his music, a move from Universal Republic to Mercury/Island Def Jam was engineered. The single reached the top spot in the United States for one week on the Billboard Hot 100. In an interview with The Guardian, it was stated that \"Cruz was clever to have hooked up with a US rapper Ludacris on his breakthrough hit\". In order to introduce Cruz into the U.S. market, David Massey had suggested that the single feature an American rapper with chart credibility. The album spawned two other UK singles, \"No Other One\", and the top-ten hit \"Dirty Picture\" featuring American electropop singer Kesha. The album's fourth single (second in the United States) titled \"Dynamite\" debuted at 26 and peaked at number two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. At the 2011 Brit Awards, \"Dynamite\" was nominated for Best British Single, and at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards the song won three Billboard Awards, including Top Hot 100 Song. Rokstarr was followed by the compilation album The Rokstarr Collection which includes songs both from Departure and the international version of Rokstarr. Cruz later released four versions of his single \"Higher\"--one featuring Kylie Minogue, one featuring Travie McCoy, one featuring both, and one with just himself. Cruz has also been featured on the soundtrack of American reality TV series Jersey Shore.
