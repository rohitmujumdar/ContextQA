{"paragraphs": [{"context": "\"First Nations\" came into common usage in the 1980s to replace the term \"Indian band\". Elder Sol Sanderson says that he coined the term in the early 1980s. Others state that the term came into common usage in the 1970s to avoid using the word \"Indian\", which some people considered offensive. Apparently, no legal definition of the term exists. Some Aboriginal peoples in Canada have also adopted the term \"First Nation\" to replace the word \"band\" in the name of their community. \"First Nations\" (most often used in the plural) has come into general use for the Indigenous peoples of North America located in what is now Canada, and their descendants, excluding the Inuit and Metis, who have distinct identities. The singular commonly used is \"First Nations person\" (when gender-specific, \"First Nations man\" or \"First Nations woman\"). Some tribal governments of Canada also use the term \"First Nations\" to refer to any indigenous, tribal or nomadic society, using the term for such diverse groups as the Romani, Saami, Maori, Hmong, and the Australian Aborigines. Although the Canadian government has formally adopted use of the term \"First Nations\" and \"Aboriginal peoples\", the federal ministerial portfolio in charge of their affairs is named the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and under the Federal Identity Program is referred to as Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC), and the historical term \"Indian Reserve\" is still a legal land description. Some First Nations peoples also use \"Indian Band\" in their official names.
