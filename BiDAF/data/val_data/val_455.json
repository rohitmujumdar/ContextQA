{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In June 2015, Urban released \"John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16\", as the lead single to his eighth American studio album, Ripcord. In October 2015, Urban teased a new song called \"Break on Me\"; it was released to the public on 23 October. It reached number one on the Country Airplay chart. On 22 September 2015, Urban celebrated the 10th anniversary of his third studio album Golden Road being certified triple platinum, for sales of three million copies of his record. \"Wasted Time\" was released as the album's third single and it went on to reach the number one spot on the Country Airplay chart. \"Blue Ain't Your Color\" was released as the album's fourth single and became a huge hit for Urban. It topped the Hot Country Songs chart as well as the Country Airplay Chart, spending twelve weeks at number one on the former chart. \"The Fighter\", a duet with Carrie Underwood, was released as the fifth single from the album. In 2016, Urban was selected as one of thirty artists to perform on \"Forever Country\", a medley of \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\", \"On the Road Again\", and \"I Will Always Love You\" which celebrates 50 years of the CMA Awards. On 8 November 2017, Urban released \"Female\", which has been described as \"an empowerment anthem partially inspired by the Harvey Weinstein scandal.\" Urban said of the song that \"as a husband and a father of two young girls, it affects me in a lot of ways. And as a son -- my mother is alive. It just speaks to all of the females in my life, particularly. For a guy who grew up with no sisters in a house of boys, it's incredible how now I'm surrounded by girls. But not only in my house; I employ a huge amount of women in my team. The song just hit me for so many reasons.\" Kidman provided background vocals on the song, which was slated to be the lead single for Urban's upcoming studio album.
