{"paragraphs": [{"context": "White has long been a proponent of analog equipment and the associated working methods. Beginning in the fifth grade, he and his childhood friend, Dominic Suchyta, would listen to records in White's attic on weekends and began to record cover songs on an old four-track reel to reel tape machine. The White Stripes' first album was largely recorded in the attic of his parents' home. As their fame grew beyond Detroit, the Stripes became known for their affected innocence and stripped-down playing style. In particular, White became distinguished for his nasal vocal delivery and loose, explosive guitar delivery. In an early New York Times concert review from 2001, Ann Powers said that, while White's playing was \"ingenious,\" he \"created more challenges by playing an acoustic guitar with paper taped over the hole and a less-than-high-quality solid body electric.\" His home studio in Nashville contains two rooms (\"I want everyone close, focused, feeling like we're in it together.\") with two pieces of equipment: a Neve mixing console, and two Studer A800 2-inch 8-track tape recorders. In his introduction in the documentary film, It Might Get Loud, White showcases his minimalist style by constructing a guitar built out of a plank of wood, three nails, a glass Coke bottle, a guitar string, and a pickup. He ends the demonstration by saying, \"Who says you need to buy a guitar?\" In a 2012 episode of the show, Portlandia, White made a cameo in a sketch spoofing home studio enthusiasts who prefer antique recording equipment.
