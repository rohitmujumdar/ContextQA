{"paragraphs": [{"context": "The earliest Super Furry Animals track commercially available is \"Dim Brys: Dim Chwys\", recorded in 1994 for Radio Cymru: an ambient piece, the track shows the band's techno roots. However, by the time it was released (on the \"Triskedekaphilia\" compilation album in August 1995), the band had already put out their debut EP on the Ankst label. The Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch (In Space) EP appeared in June 1995 and has been listed in the Guinness Book of Records as having the longest-ever title for an EP. The Moog Droog EP followed in October 1995, named after the synthesiser manufacturer Robert Moog and the Nadsat term for \"friend\" in A Clockwork Orange. The EP's title is also a pun on the Welsh \"mwg drwg\", meaning \"wacky baccy\" (slang for cannabis, more literally \"bad (or naughty) smoke\"). The lyrics on all the tracks on both EPs were in Welsh, except for \"God! Show Me Magic\" from \"Moog Droog\". After gigging in London in late 1995, they were noticed by Creation Records boss Alan McGee at the Camden Monarch club, who signed them to his label. Creation was also home to Primal Scream, My Bloody Valentine and Teenage Fanclub, and had recently found massive commercial success with Oasis. The band have said that having watched their gig, McGee asked them if they could sing in English rather than Welsh in future shows. In fact, by this stage they were singing in English, but McGee didn't realise because their Welsh accents were so strong. The Super Furry Animals received some criticism in the Welsh media for singing in English, something which the band felt \"completely pissed\" about. According to drummer Dafydd Ieuan: \"It all started when we played this festival in West Wales, and for some reason the Welsh media started foaming at the mouth because we were singing songs in Welsh and English. But they get The Dubliners playing and they don't sing in Irish. It's ridiculous.\" The band have claimed that the decision to sing in English was taken in order to broaden their fanbase. In 1999, NME readers named them 'best new band' in January (this despite the fact it was now three years since they released their debut album). In May, the single \"Northern Lites\" was released and made No. 11 in the charts. A dense production, with steel drums clattering out a calypso rhythm whilst Rhys sang an irreverent lyric about the El Nino-Southern Oscillation weather phenomenon, it was an apt taster for the new album, Guerrilla. Recorded at the Real World Studios, the album retained SFA's pop melodies but took a less guitar-centric approach to their execution and was their most experimental work to date. Layers of samples over brass, percussion and Gruff's melodic singing produced an album which took the freewheeling approach of 1960s groups such as The Beatles, The Beach Boys and The Velvet Underground and updated it to the late 1990s. The album swung from glam and garage rock numbers (\"Night Vision\", \"The Teacher\") to novelty techno (\"Wherever I Lay My Phone (That's My Home)\"), ambient indietronica (\"Some Things Come From Nothing\") and upbeat drum and bass (\"The Door To This House Remains Open\"). For the cover art, Pete Fowler created the band's first three-dimensional models, rather than the paintings he had supplied for the Radiator album and singles. After playing several of the summer festivals, SFA released \"Fire in My Heart\", the most soulful track from Guerrilla, in August and saw it chart at No. 25. They then embarked on a US and UK tour. SFA finished their UK tour at the Cardiff International Arena in Cardiff, where they showcased the first ever concert in surround sound and broadcast it on the World Wide Web. January 2000 involved a series of changes for SFA. The last single from Guerrilla, \"Do or Die\", was released and made No. 20. It was also the last single SFA released on Creation Records, as founder Alan McGee set off to pursue other interests. It had always been SFA's plan to release their next album on their own label, Placid Casual, as it would be a deliberate sidestep from their recent work: a largely acoustic album of Welsh language songs entitled Mwng. Meaning \"mane\", its lilting melodies established that SFA's songwriting did not have to fall back on head-spinning production tricks. A limited edition (of 3000) 7 inch record, \"Ysbeidiau Heulog\" (meaning \"Sunny Intervals\") preceded Mwng in May 2000. It came backed with \"Charge\", a hard-rock jam recorded as a Peel Session for the BBC. The album, released the same month, sold remarkably well for a non-English LP - it made No. 11 in the charts - and received a rare distinction for a pop record, being commended in Parliament for its efforts in keeping the Welsh language alive. 2000 also saw the Furries contribute two tracks, Free Now and Peter Blake 2000, for the Liverpool Sound Collage project, which was nominated for a Grammy. They undertook this remixing of unreleased Beatles recordings at the invitation of Paul McCartney, whom they had met at the NME Awards, where they had won Best Live Act. With the demise of Creation, SFA needed to find a new label for their next album. Sony had long held a substantial stake in Creation and offered deals to many ex-Creation artists, including SFA, who signed with one of Sony's subsidiaries, Epic. The band pushed for a deal which allowed them to take a new album elsewhere if the label wasn't interested in releasing it - thereby allowing them to find a home for any esoteric project they might want to undertake in the future. The greater resources afforded them by Epic were apparent in their first album for the label, Rings Around the World, an album that recaptured the cohesive, experimental feel of Guerrilla but more song-driven and sonically expansive. It is cited by many critics and fans alike as their most polished and accessible work. Again the first single was a good indication of what was to come: \"Juxtapozed with U\", released in July 2001, was a lush soul record which made No. 14 in the charts. The album followed in the same month and major label marketing muscle made it their biggest-seller to date, reaching No. 3 in the album charts. One of the tracks from the album, \"Receptacle For the Respectable\" featured Paul McCartney on \"carrot and celery rhythm track\" (a homage to his performance on the Beach Boys' \"Vegetables\"). SFA unleashed their experimental side on tracks such as \"Sidewalk Serfer Girl\" (which switches between light techno-pop and hardcore punk), \"[A] Touch Sensitive\" (gloomy trip-hop) and \"No Sympathy\" (which descends into chaotic drum'n'bass), but also apparent was an angrier edge to the lyrics: \"Run! Christian, Run!\" seemed to be an attack on the complacency of organised religion. Rings Around the World is also remarkable for being the world's first simultaneous release of an audio and DVD album. It was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize in 2001. The ceremony took place on the day after the terror attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and SFA's performance of the album track \"It's Not the End of the World?\" took on a somewhat bitter edge. It was released as a single in January 2002 (chart No. 30), following \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\" (chart No. 28): neither had that much impact but still received some airplay, notably on BBC Radio 2. The next album, Phantom Power, relied less on sound experimentation and proved to be a more stripped-down, back-to-basics recording in contrast to the orchestral Rings Around the World. It was also released as both a CD and DVD album in July 2003, preceded by a single, \"Golden Retriever\", in June (chart No. 13). Although the reviews for the album were generally good and it sold well initially, charting at No. 4, the album broke little new ground by SFA's standards and the band had fallen out of fashion, receiving little coverage in the music press. Another single, \"Hello Sunshine\", hit No. 31 in October 2003 and was eventually featured on the soundtrack of The O.C..
