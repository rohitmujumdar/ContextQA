{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 1989, They Might Be Giants signed with Elektra Records, and released their third album Flood the following year. Flood earned them a platinum album, largely thanks to the success of \"Birdhouse in Your Soul\" which reached number three on the US Modern Rock chart, as well as \"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\", a cover of a song originally by The Four Lads. In 1990, Throttle magazine interviewed They Might Be Giants and clarified the meaning of the song \"Ana Ng\": John Flansburgh said, \"Ng is a Vietnamese name. The song is about someone who's thinking about a person on the exact opposite side of the world. John looked at a globe and figured out that if Ana Ng is in Vietnam and the person is on the other side of the world, then it must be written by someone in Peru\". Further interest in the band was generated when two cartoon music videos were created by Warner Bros. Animation for Tiny Toon Adventures: \"Istanbul\" and \"Particle Man\". The videos reflected TMBG's high \"kid appeal\", resulting from their often absurd songs and poppy melodies. In 1991, Bar/None Records released the B-sides compilation Miscellaneous T. The title referred to the section of the record store where TMBG releases were often found as well as to the overall eclectic nature of the tracks. Though consisting of previously released material (save for the \"Purple Toupee\" b-sides, which were not available publicly), it gave new fans a chance to hear the Johns' earlier non-album work without having to hunt down the individual EPs. In early 1992, They Might Be Giants released Apollo 18. The heavy space theme coincided with TMBG being named Musical Ambassadors for International Space Year. Singles from the album included \"The Statue Got Me High\", \"I Palindrome I\", and \"The Guitar (The Lion Sleeps Tonight)\". Apollo 18 was also notable for being one of the first albums to take advantage of the CD player's shuffle feature. The song \"Fingertips\" actually comprised 21 separate tracks -- short snippets that not only acted together to make the song but that when played in random order would be interspersed between the album's full-length songs. Due to mastering errors, the UK and Australian versions of Apollo 18 contained \"Fingertips\" as one track.
