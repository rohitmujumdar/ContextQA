{"paragraphs": [{"context": "The Gregorys travelled in Ceylon, India, Spain, Italy and Egypt. While in Egypt, Lady Gregory had an affair with the English poet Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, during which she wrote a series of love poems, A Woman's Sonnets. Her earliest work to appear under her own name was Arabi and His Household (1882), a pamphlet--originally a letter to The Times--in support of Ahmed Orabi Pasha, leader of what has come to be known as the Urabi Revolt, an 1879 Egyptian nationalist revolt against the oppressive regime of the Khedive and the European domination of Egypt. She later said of this booklet, \"whatever political indignation or energy was born with me may have run its course in that Egyptian year and worn itself out\". Despite this, in 1893 she published A Phantom's Pilgrimage, or Home Ruin, an anti-Nationalist pamphlet against William Ewart Gladstone's proposed second Home Rule Act. She continued to write prose during the period of her marriage. During the winter of 1883, whilst her husband was in Ceylon, she worked on a series of memoirs of her childhood home, with a view to publishing them under the title An Emigrant's Notebook, but this plan was abandoned. She wrote a series of pamphlets in 1887 called Over the River, in which she appealed for funds for the parish of St. Stephens in Southwark, south London. She also wrote a number of short stories in the years 1890 and 1891, although these also never appeared in print. A number of unpublished poems from this period have also survived. When Sir William Gregory died in March 1892, Lady Gregory went into mourning and returned to Coole Park; there she edited her husband's autobiography, which she published in 1894. She was to write later, \"If I had not married I should not have learned the quick enrichment of sentences that one gets in conversation; had I not been widowed I should not have found the detachment of mind, the leisure for observation necessary to give insight into character, to express and interpret it. Loneliness made me rich--'full', as Bacon says.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What were some of the early writings of Augusta?", "answers": [{"text": "Her earliest work to appear under her own name was Arabi and His Household (1882), a pamphlet--originally a letter to The Times", "answer_start": 218}, {"text": "While in Egypt, Lady Gregory had an affair with the English poet Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, during which she wrote a series of love poems, A Woman's Sonnets.", "answer_start": 65}, {"text": "she wrote a series of love poems, A Woman's Sonnets.", "answer_start": 165}, {"text": "Her earliest work to appear under her own name was Arabi and His Household (1882),", "answer_start": 218}, {"text": "Lady Gregory had an affair with the English poet Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, during which she wrote a series of love poems, A Woman's Sonnets.", "answer_start": 81}], "id": "C_3afea7a4f02443b0bef9899717f27f62_1_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "Lady Gregory had an affair with the English poet Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, during which she wrote a series of love poems, A Woman's Sonnets.", "answer_start": 81}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "y", "question": "Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?", "answers": [{"text": "The Gregorys travelled in Ceylon, India, Spain, Italy and Egypt.
