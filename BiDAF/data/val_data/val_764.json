{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In the early 1880s, Sun Mei sent his brother to `Iolani School, which was under the supervision of British Anglicans and directed by an Anglican prelate named Alfred Willis. The language of instruction was English. Although Bishop Willis emphasized that no one was forced to accept Christianity, the students were required to attend chapel on Sunday. At Iolani School, young Sun Wen first came in contact with Christianity, and it made a deep impression on him. Schriffin writes that Christianity was to have a great influence on Sun's whole future political life. Sun was later baptized in Hong Kong (on May 4, 1884) by Rev. C. R. Hager an American missionary of the Congregational Church of the United States (ABCFM) to his brother's disdain. The minister would also develop a friendship with Sun. Sun attended To Tsai Church (Dao Ji Hui Tang ), founded by the London Missionary Society in 1888, while he studied Western Medicine in Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese. Sun pictured a revolution as similar to the salvation mission of the Christian church. His conversion to Christianity was related to his revolutionary ideals and push for advancement. In 1924 Liao Chongzhen, a prominent and influential government official of the day, arranged a meeting between Sun and Martha Root, a well-known journalist and traveling teacher of the Baha'i Faith in the late 19th and early 20th century. In this meeting Sun came into contact with the Teachings of the Baha'i Faith, expressing his appreciation for the Cause and declaring it \"highly relevant to the needs of China.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What religion was Sun born with?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1579}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1579}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1579}], "id": "C_dcb4717fe0b543e39ae34e121fdc1003_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1579}}, {"followup": "n", "yesno": "y", "question": "Did the article say why he was interested in Christianity?", "answers": [{"text": "At Iolani School, young Sun Wen first came in contact with Christianity, and it made a deep impression on him.", "answer_start": 351}, {"text": "it made a deep impression on him.", "answer_start": 428}, {"text": "Schriffin writes that Christianity was to have a great influence on Sun's whole future political life.", "answer_start": 462}], "id": "C_dcb4717fe0b543e39ae34e121fdc1003_0_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "Schriffin writes that Christianity was to have a great influence on Sun's whole future political life.", "answer_start": 462}}, {"followup": "m", "yesno": "y", "question": "Is there any other data on his religious views?", "answers": [{"text": "Christianity was to have a great influence on Sun's whole future political life.", "answer_start": 484}, {"text": "Sun pictured a revolution as similar to the salvation mission of the Christian church.", "answer_start": 978}, {"text": "Sun was later baptized in Hong Kong (on May 4, 1884) by Rev.
