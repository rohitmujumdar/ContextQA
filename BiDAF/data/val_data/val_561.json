{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Thames Television wiped the material once they had acquired the Rediffusion London archive, and all but two episodes were destroyed. John Cleese became aware of tapes from two surviving episodes after Feldman's wife left them to him in her will. Five compilation episodes for Swedish television also survived. Much missing material has been recovered in video, and surviving video has been restored by the British Film Institute. The majority of a previously missing episode (season 2, episode 6 tx 31.10.67) was returned to the BFI in May 2010. On 23 October 2014, the BFI announced film copies of two previously missing episodes - the first and final episodes of the series (tx 15.02.1967 and 07.11.1967) - had been recovered from the private collection of the show's executive producer David Frost. A year later, the BFI announced the recovery of another two episodes, with one of the new recoveries - the third episode of the first series (tx 01.03.1967) - to be screened at the Radio Times Festival at Hampton Court on 25 September 2015. Out of an original total of 13 episodes, eleven now exist in complete or near-complete form, while two remain incomplete. While most surviving episodes are from original tapes or telerecordings, two of the complete episodes have been reconstructed from footage recovered from five compilation tapes returned from Sweden. The two incomplete episodes' surviving footage also comes from these compilations. The complete audio of all 13 episodes exist, recorded off air by several fans. An LP compilation was produced using audio from the original videotapes. This has since been reissued on CD.
