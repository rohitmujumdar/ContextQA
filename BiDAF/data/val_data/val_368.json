{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Halfway through the broadcasting of the first season, Adult Swim picked up Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! for another season ordering as many as 30 new episodes. The second season began airing on November 18, 2007. Season one was released on DVD in April, 2008. The third season began on July 27, 2008 and ended on September 28, 2008. Eric posted a MySpace bulletin Oct 1, 2008, announcing that as a \"holiday surprise\" season four would be airing in January 2009. The show was later renewed for a fifth season. Speaking with Vanity Fair in July 2009, Wareheim said that season five (or \"Season Cinco\") would represent \"a very dark side of the Awesome Show series. I think people are going to be very scared and very disturbed by it.\" He also noted that the pair draw equal humor from the awkwardness of The Office as they do from the awkwardness of David Lynch's films. The duo went on to state that they had begun an unconscious tradition by starting the first episode of seasons two, three, and four each with fecal-related fake commercials; they plan to \"outdo\" themselves on season five with a \"diarrhea disease\"-based commercial. The fifth season premiered on February 28, 2010. The series finale aired on May 2, 2010. On May 16, 2010 the spin-off Check it Out! premiered. Tim and Eric acquired funding to shoot and air a one-hour special that aired on December 5, 2010, called The Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job Chrimbus Special. Simultaneous to this announcement, the duo also released a list of dates and cities for their upcoming 2010 tour. Tim and Eric also announced plans for a movie, entitled Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie; in the film, released online and on pay-per-view on January 27, 2012, the pair try to revitalize a run-down mall in order to pay a billion-dollar debt. The duo's Abso Lutely Productions signoff bumper features a video clip of Heidecker's father during a family vacation in 1991; when asked to sum the trip up in two words, he responded \"Abso-lutely.\" The full clip can be found on their website, DVD, and also on YouTube.

The show features surreal and often satirical humor (at points anti-humor and cringe comedy), public-access television-style musical acts, bizarre faux-commercials with a unique editing and special effects style by Doug Lussenhop to make the show appear camp. The program featured a wide range of actors like Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, Jeff Goldblum, Zach Galifianakis, Will Forte, Patton Oswalt, Bob Odenkirk, David Cross, Fred Willard, Rainn Wilson, Fred Armisen, Paul Rudd, and Ben Stiller, alternative comedians like Neil Hamburger, former television stars like Alan Thicke, porn stars, celebrity look-alikes, impressionists, and amateur actors found through Craigslist. The creators of the show have described it as \"the nightmare version of television\".", "title": "Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!"}
