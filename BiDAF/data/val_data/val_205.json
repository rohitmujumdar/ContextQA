{"paragraphs": [{"context": "On November 17, 2010, Zenyatta was slated to be retired. She arrived at Lane's End Farm in Versailles, Kentucky, on December 6, 2010. On February 23, 2011, she traveled by van to Darley Stud, where she was bred to Bernardini. On March 29, after coming up negative on a 45-day pregnancy checkup, Zenyatta was bred again to Bernardini. She was announced to be in foal 60 days later. Zenyatta later give birth to a dark bay colt, eventually named Cozmic One, on March 8, 2012. Cozmic One had two starts in 2015 and performed poorly at the track. He has since been retired and in 2018 will become an ambassador for the Retired Racehorse Project after training at De Sousa Stables. On May 8, 2012, she was confirmed in foal to Tapit. She delivered a chestnut colt, Ziconic, on April 1, 2013, her 9th birthday. Ziconic began his racing career in 2016, and, like his dam, demonstrates a last-to-first running style. On June 14, 2013, she was confirmed in foal to Claiborne Farm stallion War Front. She delivered a dark bay filly, nicknamed \"Z Princess,\" on Easter, April 20, 2014, at 12:03 am. The filly was euthanized as a weanling on October 28, 2014 at Rood & Riddle Equine Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, after an accident in the paddock. On May 27, 2015, Zenyata was confirmed to be in foal, again bred to War Front, after receiving a year off from breeding. She gave birth to a dark bay colt with a blaze on April 10, 2016.
