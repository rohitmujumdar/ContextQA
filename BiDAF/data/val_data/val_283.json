{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In an interview with the South Florida Sun-Sentinel in December 2009, it was revealed by lead singer Stephen Christian that the band were tentatively due to enter the studio in the beginning of 2010, with a release probable later in the year. He said \"it looks like we are going to go to the studio in January, February or March, right around that time\". Drummer Nathan Young stated that the album would be \"less poppy\" and \"darker\". Christian posted on his Twitter account in December 2009, that his choice for an album name was \"a go\" but did not reveal the name. The band entered Blackbird Studios, Nashville, to begin recording the album in March 2010. It was announced on March 3 that the band would be working with Grammy Award-winning producer, Brendan O'Brien. The tracking of the album was completed on April 9, with mixing commencing on April 13, 2010. In an April 2010 interview with MyMag, Christian stated that the album's release date is \"looking like late July or early August\" 2010. However, in a May 2010 interview with Spin Magazine, McAlhaney stated that the album would be released in September 2010. In early June 2010, the album's release date was confirmed to be September 21, 2010. The band also began exposing their new music, with videos of live performances of the album's songs appearing online. A press release revealed on June 17 that Anberlin's fifth studio album would be titled Dark Is the Way, Light Is a Place, taking its title from a line in Dylan Thomas' \"Poem on His Birthday\". Along with the disclosure of a track listing, the press release also announced the album's lead single, \"Impossible\", which went to radio play on July 12, 2010. When asked about the possible impact of the new album, Stephen replied 'I feel like we're on the brink of something... either world domination or destruction, but either way we're on the brink'. Anberlin supported Thirty Seconds to Mars on their Closer to the Edge Tour with CB7 during April and May 2011.
