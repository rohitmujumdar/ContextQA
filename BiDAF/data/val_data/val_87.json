{"paragraphs": [{"context": "By the 1980s Little had turned to full-time acting, making his theatre debut in Black Cockatoos before appearing in director Wim Wenders' 1991 film Until the end of the World. As well as appearing in Tracy Moffatt's The Night Cries and Andrew Schultz's opera Black River, his teaching and community work earned him the title of NAIDOC Aboriginal of the Year in 1989. After winning that award Little returned to working in the music industry. In 1992, Little performed at the Tamworth on Parade and Kings of Country roadshows before releasing his 14th album, Yorta Yorta Man, in 1994. The same year, he was inducted into Tamworth's Country Music Roll of Renown, the highest honour an Australian country music artist can achieve. Messenger, a collection of contemporary songs reinterpreted through Little's smooth vocals, was released in June 1999 and peaked at No. 26 nationally, selling over 20,000 copies. It had been organised by Brendan Gallagher (from Karma County) and featured covers of well-known songs by Australian artists: \"(Are You) The One I've Been Waiting For?\" by Nick Cave, \"The Way I Made You Feel\" by Ed Kuepper and \"Randwick Bells\" by Paul Kelly. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999 Messenger won Best Adult Contemporary Album and Little was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. At The Deadly Awards of 1999 - the annual Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Music Awards - he won Best Male Artist of the Year and Best Single Release of the Year. By 2001 Messenger was certified by ARIA with a gold record for shipments of 35,000 units.
