{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Tubman was born Araminta \"Minty\" Ross to slave parents, Harriet (\"Rit\") Green and Ben Ross. Rit was owned by Mary Pattison Brodess (and later her son Edward). Ben was held by Anthony Thompson, who became Mary's second husband, and who ran a large plantation near Blackwater River in Madison, Maryland. As with many slaves in the United States, neither the exact year nor place of Araminta's birth is known, and historians differ as to the best estimate. Kate Larson records the year as 1822, based on a midwife payment and several other historical documents, including her runaway advertisement, while Jean Humez says \"the best current evidence suggests that Tubman was born in 1820, but it might have been a year or two later.\" Catherine Clinton notes that Tubman reported the year of her birth as 1825, while her death certificate lists 1815 and her gravestone lists 1820. In her Civil War widow's pension records, Tubman claimed she was born in 1820, 1822, and 1825, an indication, perhaps, that she had only a general idea of when she was born. Modesty, Tubman's maternal grandmother, arrived in the United States on a slave ship from Africa; no information is available about her other ancestors. As a child, Tubman was told that she seemed like an Ashanti person due to her character traits, though no evidence exists to confirm this lineage. Her mother Rit (who may have had a white father) was a cook for the Brodess family. Her father Ben was a skilled woodsman who managed the timber work on Thompson's plantation. They married around 1808 and, according to court records, they had nine children together: Linah, Mariah Ritty, Soph, Robert, Minty (Harriet), Ben, Rachel, Henry, and Moses. Rit struggled to keep her family together as slavery threatened to tear it apart. Edward Brodess sold three of her daughters (Linah, Mariah Ritty, and Soph), separating them from the family forever. When a trader from Georgia approached Brodess about buying Rit's youngest son, Moses, she hid him for a month, aided by other slaves and free blacks in the community. At one point she confronted her owner about the sale. Finally, Brodess and \"the Georgia man\" came toward the slave quarters to seize the child, where Rit told them, \"You are after my son; but the first man that comes into my house, I will split his head open.\" Brodess backed away and abandoned the sale. Tubman's biographers agree that stories told about this event within the family influenced her belief in the possibilities of resistance. By 1840, Tubman's father, Ben, was manumitted from slavery at the age of 45, as stipulated in a former owner's will, though his actual age was closer to 55. He continued working as a timber estimator and foreman for the Thompson family, who had held him as a slave. Several years later, Tubman contacted a white attorney and paid him five dollars to investigate her mother's legal status. The lawyer discovered that a former owner had issued instructions that Rit, like her husband, would be manumitted at the age of 45. The record showed that a similar provision would apply to Rit's children, and that any children born after she reached 45 years of age were legally free, but the Pattison and Brodess families had ignored this stipulation when they inherited the slaves. Challenging it legally was an impossible task for Tubman. Around 1844, she married a free black man named John Tubman. Although little is known about him or their time together, the union was complicated because of her slave status. Since the mother's status dictated that of children, any children born to Harriet and John would be enslaved. Such blended marriages - free people of color marrying enslaved people - were not uncommon on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where by this time, half the black population was free. Most African-American families had both free and enslaved members. Larson suggests that they might have planned to buy Tubman's freedom. Tubman changed her name from Araminta to Harriet soon after her marriage, though the exact timing is unclear. Larson suggests this happened right after the wedding, and Clinton suggests that it coincided with Tubman's plans to escape from slavery. She adopted her mother's name, possibly as part of a religious conversion, or to honor another relative. In April 1858, Tubman was introduced to the abolitionist John Brown, an insurgent who advocated the use of violence to destroy slavery in the United States. Although she never advocated violence against whites, she agreed with his course of direct action and supported his goals. Like Tubman, he spoke of being called by God, and trusted the divine to protect him from the wrath of slaveholders. She, meanwhile, claimed to have had a prophetic vision of meeting Brown before their encounter. Thus, as he began recruiting supporters for an attack on slaveholders, Brown was joined by \"General Tubman\", as he called her. Her knowledge of support networks and resources in the border states of Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware was invaluable to Brown and his planners. Although other abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison did not endorse his tactics, Brown dreamed of fighting to create a new state for freed slaves, and made preparations for military action. After he began the first battle, he believed, slaves would rise up and carry out a rebellion across the south. He asked Tubman to gather former slaves then living in present-day Southern Ontario who might be willing to join his fighting force, which she did. On May 8, 1858, Brown held a meeting in Chatham, Ontario, where he unveiled his plan for a raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia. When word of the plan was leaked to the government, Brown put the scheme on hold and began raising funds for its eventual resumption. Tubman aided him in this effort, and with more detailed plans for the assault. Tubman was busy during this time, giving talks to abolitionist audiences and tending to her relatives. In the autumn of 1859, as Brown and his men prepared to launch the attack, Tubman could not be contacted. When the raid on Harpers Ferry took place on October 16, Tubman was not present. Some historians believe she was in New York at the time, ill with fever related to her childhood head injury. Others propose she may have been recruiting more escaped slaves in Ontario, and Kate Clifford Larson suggests she may have been in Maryland, recruiting for Brown's raid or attempting to rescue more family members. Larson also notes that Tubman may have begun sharing Frederick Douglass's doubts about the viability of the plan. The raid failed; Brown was convicted of treason and hanged in December. His actions were seen by abolitionists as a symbol of proud resistance, carried out by a noble martyr. Tubman herself was effusive with praise. She later told a friend: \"[H]e done more in dying, than 100 men would in living.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "m", "yesno": "x", "question": "What happened at Harpers Ferry?", "answers": [{"text": "the raid on Harpers Ferry took place on October 16,", "answer_start": 6093}, {"text": "On May 8, 1858, Brown held a meeting in Chatham, Ontario, where he unveiled his plan for a raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia.", "answer_start": 5542}, {"text": "On May 8, 1858, Brown held a meeting in Chatham, Ontario, where he unveiled his plan for a raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia.", "answer_start": 5542}, {"text": "plan for a raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia.", "answer_start": 5622}, {"text": "When the raid on Harpers Ferry took place", "answer_start": 6088}], "id": "C_bb8d8f760b1a4543a0f05a37ee047188_1_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "When the raid on Harpers Ferry took place", "answer_start": 6088}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "Who was John Brown?", "answers": [{"text": "abolitionist John Brown, an insurgent who advocated the use of violence to destroy slavery in the United States.", "answer_start": 4340}, {"text": "In April 1858, Tubman was introduced to the abolitionist John Brown, an insurgent who advocated the use of violence to destroy slavery in the United States.", "answer_start": 4296}, {"text": "April 1858, Tubman was introduced to the abolitionist John Brown,", "answer_start": 4299}, {"text": "Brown dreamed of fighting to create a new state for freed slaves, and made preparations for military action.", "answer_start": 5174}, {"text": "the abolitionist John Brown, an insurgent who advocated the use of violence to destroy slavery in the United States.", "answer_start": 4336}], "id": "C_bb8d8f760b1a4543a0f05a37ee047188_1_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "the abolitionist John Brown, an insurgent who advocated the use of violence to destroy slavery in the United States.", "answer_start": 4336}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "y", "question": "Was he part of the raid on Harpers Ferry?", "answers": [{"text": "Brown and his men prepared to launch the attack,", "answer_start": 6008}, {"text": "The raid failed; Brown was convicted of treason and hanged in December.", "answer_start": 6607}, {"text": "The raid failed; Brown was convicted of treason and hanged in December.", "answer_start": 6607}, {"text": "The raid failed; Brown was convicted of treason and hanged in December.", "answer_start": 6607}, {"text": "In the autumn of 1859, as Brown and his men prepared to launch the attack,", "answer_start": 5982}], "id": "C_bb8d8f760b1a4543a0f05a37ee047188_1_q#2", "orig_answer": {"text": "In the autumn of 1859, as Brown and his men prepared to launch the attack,", "answer_start": 5982}}, {"followup": "n", "yesno": "x", "question": "What happened during the attack?", "answers": [{"text": "The raid failed;", "answer_start": 6607}, {"text": "When the raid on Harpers Ferry took place on October 16, Tubman was not present.", "answer_start": 6088}, {"text": "The raid failed;", "answer_start": 6607}, {"text": "The raid failed; Brown was convicted of treason and hanged in December.
