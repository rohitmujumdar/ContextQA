Majhid Heath of ABC Online Indigenous gave the album two-and-a-half out of five stars, writing that it's a \"non-cohesive mess of similar sounding, auto-tuned ravaged pop/R&B that diminishes the talent of this brilliant young songstress\". The album's title track, featuring American rapper Snoop Dogg, peaked at number 19. Mauboy performed \"Get 'Em Girls\" at the 2010 Nickelodeon Australian Kids' Choice Awards, where she co-hosted the award ceremony with Liam Hemsworth and Jerry Trainor, and won the award for Fave Aussie Muso.

She said, \"This time around with the album I would like to...just take risks in terms of the sound and identifying who I am as a woman. It's more of a rhythmic pop so it's not going to be extreme pop. It's going to be a little bit more soul.\" The album's lead single \"This Ain't Love\" was released in September 2015; it peaked at number five and was certified gold.
