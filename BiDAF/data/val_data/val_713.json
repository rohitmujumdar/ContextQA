{"paragraphs": [{"context": "The Eagles were formed in September 1971, and signed to David Geffen's label Asylum Records. They released their first studio album in 1972, which contained the hit song \"Take It Easy\", written by Frey and Jackson Browne. During the band's run, Henley co-wrote (usually with Frey) most of the band's best-known songs. \"Witchy Woman\", which was co-written with Leadon, was his first commercially successful song, while \"Desperado\" marks the beginning of his songwriting partnership with Frey. Henley sang lead vocals on many of the band's popular songs, including \"Desperado\", \"Witchy Woman\", \"Best of My Love\", \"One of These Nights\", \"Hotel California\", \"The Long Run\", \"Life in the Fast Lane\" and \"Wasted Time\". The Eagles won numerous Grammy Awards during the 1970s and became one of the world's most successful rock bands of all time. They are also among the top 5 overall best-selling bands of all time in America and the highest selling American band in U.S. history. Henley and Frey have been called the American version of McCartney and Lennon. The band broke up in 1980, following a difficult tour and personal tensions that arose during the recording of The Long Run. The Eagles subsequently reunited 14 years later in 1994. Henley continues to tour and record with the Eagles. Their latest album, Long Road Out of Eden, was released in 2007. The band had a number of highly successful tours, such as the Hell Freezes Over Tour (1994-1996), and Long Road Out of Eden Tour. On April 1, 2013, during a concert at the Casino Rama in Rama, Ontario, Henley announced the History of the Eagles Tour, which began in July 2013 and ended in July 2015, six months before Frey's death. At the 2016 Grammy Awards, the Eagles and Jackson Browne performed \"Take It Easy\" as a tribute to Frey. On his songwriting in the band, Henley stated in a March 2001 interview on Charlie Rose that \"rock bands work best as a benevolent dictatorship\", with the principal songwriters in a band (in the case of the Eagles, \"me and Glenn Frey\") being the ones that will likely hold the power.
