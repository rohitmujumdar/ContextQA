{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Following the Jefferson Airplane reunion, Slick retired from the music business. During a 1998 interview with VH1 on a Behind the Music documentary featuring Jefferson Airplane, Slick, who was never shy about the idea of getting old, said that the main reason she retired from the music business was, \"All rock-and-rollers over the age of 50 look stupid and should retire.\" In a 2007 interview, she repeated her belief that, \"You can do jazz, classical, blues, opera, country until you're 150, but rap and rock and roll are really a way for young people to get that anger out\", and, \"It's silly to perform a song that has no relevance to the present or expresses feelings you no longer have.\" Despite her retirement, Slick has appeared twice with Kantner's revamped version of Jefferson Starship; the first came in 1995 when the band played at Los Angeles's House of Blues, as documented on the live album Deep Space/Virgin Sky. The second was for a post-9/11 gig in late 2001, during which she came on the stage initially covered in black from head to toe in a makeshift burqa. She then removed the burqa to reveal a covering bearing an American flag and the words \"Fuck Fear\". Her statement to fans on the outfit was: \"The outfit is not about Islam, it's about oppression; this flag is not about politics, it's about liberty.\" After retiring from music, Slick began painting and drawing. She has done many renditions of her fellow 1960s musicians, such as Janis Joplin, Jerry Garcia, and others. In 2000, she began displaying and selling her artwork. She attends many of her art shows across the United States. She has generally refrained from engaging in the music business, although she did perform on \"Knock Me Out\", a track from In Flight, the 1996 solo debut from former 4 Non Blondes singer, and friend of daughter China, Linda Perry. The song was also on the soundtrack to the film The Crow: City of Angels. Slick released her autobiography, Somebody to Love? A Rock and Roll Memoir, in 1998 and narrated an abridged version of the book as an audiobook. A biography, Grace Slick, The Biography, by Barbara Rowes, was released in 1980 and is currently out of print. In a 2001 USA Today article, Slick said, \"I'm in good health and people want to know what I do to be this way ... I don't eat cheese, I don't eat duck--the point is I'm vegan.\" However, she admitted she's \"not strict vegan, because I'm a hedonist pig. If I see a big chocolate cake that is made with eggs, I'll have it.\" In 2006, Slick suffered from diverticulitis. After initial surgery, she had a relapse requiring further surgery and a tracheotomy. She was placed in an induced coma for two months and then had to learn to walk again. Also in 2006, Slick gave a speech at the inauguration of the new Virgin America airline, which named their first aircraft Jefferson Airplane. In 2010, Slick co-wrote Edge of Madness with singer Michelle Mangione to raise money for remediation efforts following the BP Oil Spill. Grace also sang background vocals on the song and is clearly audible in the middle of the song singing, \"On the edge of madness.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "when did she retire?", "answers": [{"text": "Following the Jefferson Airplane reunion, Slick retired from the music business.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Following the Jefferson Airplane reunion, Slick retired from the music business.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Following the Jefferson Airplane reunion, Slick retired from the music business.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "1998", "answer_start": 90}, {"text": "Following the Jefferson Airplane reunion, Slick retired from the music business.", "answer_start": 0}], "id": "C_1571624115a4485dab0b024f558be789_1_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "Following the Jefferson Airplane reunion, Slick retired from the music business.", "answer_start": 0}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "why did she retire?", "answers": [{"text": "the main reason she retired from the music business was, \"All rock-and-rollers over the age of 50 look stupid and should retire.", "answer_start": 244}, {"text": "\"All rock-and-rollers over the age of 50 look stupid and should retire.", "answer_start": 301}, {"text": "the main reason she retired from the music business was, \"All rock-and-rollers over the age of 50 look stupid and should retire.\"", "answer_start": 244}, {"text": "said that the main reason she retired from the music business was, \"All rock-and-rollers over the age of 50 look stupid and should retire.\" In a 2007 interview,", "answer_start": 234}, {"text": "said that the main reason she retired from the music business was, \"All rock-and-rollers over the age of 50 look stupid and should retire.\"", "answer_start": 234}], "id": "C_1571624115a4485dab0b024f558be789_1_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "said that the main reason she retired from the music business was, \"All rock-and-rollers over the age of 50 look stupid and should retire.\"", "answer_start": 234}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "y", "question": "Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?", "answers": [{"text": "A biography, Grace Slick, The Biography, by Barbara Rowes, was released in 1980 and is currently out of print.", "answer_start": 2063}, {"text": "Despite her retirement, Slick has appeared twice with Kantner's revamped version of Jefferson Starship;", "answer_start": 693}, {"text": "After retiring from music, Slick began painting and drawing.", "answer_start": 1329}, {"text": "After retiring from music, Slick began painting and drawing.
