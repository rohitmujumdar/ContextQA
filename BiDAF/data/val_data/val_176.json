{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 1930, Limon first performed on Broadway, and later that same year he choreographed his first dance, \"Etude in D Minor\", a duet with Letitia Ide. Limon recruited Ide and schoolmates Eleanor King and Ernestine Stodelle to form \"The Little Group\". From 1932 to 1933, Limon made two more Broadway appearances, in the musical revue Americana and in Irving Berlin's As Thousands Cheer, choreographed by Charles Weidman. Limon also tried his hand at choreography at Broadway's New Amsterdam Theatre. Limon made several more appearances throughout the next few years in shows such as Humphrey's New Dance, Theatre Piece, With my Red Fires, and Weidman's Quest. In 1937, Limon was selected as one of the first Bennington Fellows. At the Bennington Festival at Mills College in 1939, Limon created his first major choreographic work, titled Danzas Mexicanas. After five years, however, Limon would return to Broadway to star as a featured dancer in Keep Off the Grass under the choreographer George Balanchine. In 1941, Limon left the Humphrey-Weidman company to work with May O'Donnell. They co-choreographed several pieces together, such as War Lyrics and Curtain Riser. On October 3, 1942 Limon married Pauline Lawrence, a founding member and the manager of the Humphrey-Weidman company. The partnership with O'Donnell dissolved the following year, and Limon created work for a program at Humphrey-Weidman. In 1943, Limon's made his final appearance on Broadway in Balanchine's Rosalinda, a piece he performed with Mary Ellen Moylan. He spent the rest of that year creating dances on American and folk themes at the Studio Theatre before being drafted into the Army in April 1943. During this time, he collaborated with composers Frank Loesser and Alex North, choreographing several works for the U.S. Army Special Services. The most well-known among these is Concerto Grosso.
