{"paragraphs": [{"context": "During his presidency, Diem imposed programs to reform Saigon society in accordance with Catholic and Confucian values. Brothels and opium dens were closed, divorce and abortion were made illegal, and adultery laws were strengthened. Besides, Diem's government established many schools and universities, such as the National Technical Center at Phu Tho in 1957, the University of Saigon (1956), the University of Hue (1957), and the University of Dalat (1957) Diem also paid attention to the preservation of Vietnamese traditional culture. Diem restored and organized some traditional festivals, such as Hung kings ancestor festival (No, but on the contrary, Ngo Dinh Diem during his nine years in power did not allow any celebration of the Hung kings, the Vietnam National founding fathers ,and), The Trung sisters festival ... According to Diem, the values of traditional culture, along with Catholic and Confucian values were powerful in the fight against Materialism. Regarding economic development, Diem and Nhu, in the political program of the Can Lao party and National Revolutionary Movement, pointed out the key factors of the RVN economy: a developed and independent economy, support for local capitalists, stabilized currency and reduced budget deficits; enhanced building infrastructure to meet military needs and create a prosperous South Vietnam. In 1957, Diem's government suggested the 5-year plan (1957-1961), which aimed at expanding cultivated area to 20 percent and improving agricultural production to 25%, restoring exploitative industry and developing infrastructure. On 31 December 1955, Diem promulgated Decree 48 on RVN independence on currency and banknotes (This is not in accordance with the first sentence of the last paragraph under \"Being Prime Minister and consolidation of power\" subtitle, with ref 54). Diem's government also encouraged the development of handicrafts, industry, and commerce. In October 1957, Diem established the Center for Technological Development for Investment, Instruction, and Cooperation and supported private technological activities to gradually diminish the role of foreign capitalists, especially French capitalists in industry and to enhance the role of indigenous capitalists in the RVN economy. In 1961, Diem suggested the second 5-year plan (1962-1966) to continue the first 5-year plan. During the first Republic of Vietnam, some indigenous industrial zones or factories were founded, such as the Cogido paper factory in An Hao (1961), Vinatexco and Vimytex textile factories, the Khanh Hoi glassware factory, the Ha Tien and Thu Duc cement factories, the Da Nhim hydroelectric facility (1961), Da Lat nuclear research centre (1963), and the Bien Hoa industrial zone (1963). During 1956-1960, Diem built a relatively stable RVN with a stable economy along with development of infrastructure and people's standards of living due to export of home comforts. Nevertheless, Diem also admitted the dependence of RVN's economy on US assistance: \"Today, the country is not self-sufficient. We can say that foreign assistance is a kind of compensation for the services our people have provided to the free world to protect SEA market, and to fight against manipulations of international communism\".
