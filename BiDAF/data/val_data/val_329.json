{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Forte is a supporter of the camp Wampler's Kids and recorded a promotional piece at SNL with Will Ferrell. Forte was a childhood friend of founder Steven Wampler and previously the national spokesman for SciEyes, a non-profit organization created to support research, training and public education in stem cell biology and to further the field by recognizing and supporting its potential for creating new therapies for the treatment of blinding and debilitating eye diseases. He was a primary donor towards the establishment of a research fellowship for third-year medical students at Duke Medical Center. He serves on the Board of Directors of the National Policy and Advocacy Council on Homelessness. Forte is especially close with his family. His mother has visited every film set he had worked on and made an appearance on the Mother's Day episode of SNL in which he sang a song to her on Weekend Update. Forte officiated his sister Michelle's wedding and filmed the birth of his niece and nephew. During a conversation with Scott Aukerman on the podcast Comedy Bang! Bang!, Forte discussed his parents' divorce and the family's decision to have Christmas together after his father's second divorce. During the same interview, Forte joked about his obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) tendencies with a story of listening to only one song in his office at SNL for an entire year because he wanted to challenge himself. During an interview with Larry King, Forte discussed his OCD as a challenge he had to overcome but not one he wished he did not have, as it is a part of his personality. In a feature on him and his new Fox series in February 2015, the writer of the article said that Forte mentioned OCD often but it was not clear if he had ever been formally diagnosed, though Forte related how he and a former girlfriend had gone through an OCD questionnaire and it concluded that Forte \"should immediately talk to someone about this\". Forte currently resides in Santa Monica, California. He purchased his home just two weeks before joining SNL and being forced to move to New York City; \"It was not the greatest timing,\" he later said.
