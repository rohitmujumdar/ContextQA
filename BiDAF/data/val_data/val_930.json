{"paragraphs": [{"context": "On July 30, 2014, Bosh re-signed with the Heat after LeBron James announced he was leaving Miami to return to the Cleveland Cavaliers. After averaging 21.6 points, 8.2 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.1 steals over the first 23 games of the 2014-15 season, Bosh was ruled out indefinitely on December 15 with a strained calf. He went on to miss eight games before returning on December 29 against the Orlando Magic. After playing in the 2015 All-Star Game, Bosh was admitted to a Miami hospital for lung tests during the All-Star break. On February 21, 2015, he was ruled out for the remainder of the season due to a blood clot in one of his lungs. On October 28, 2015, Bosh made his return to the court in the Heat's season opener against the Charlotte Hornets, recording 21 points and 10 rebounds in a 104-94 win. On November 10, 2015, he scored a then season-high 30 points in a 101-88 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. On December 28, 2015, he recorded 24 points and 12 rebounds against the Brooklyn Nets, and hit a career-best 5-of-5 from three-point range. On January 4, 2016, he recorded a season-high 31 points and 11 rebounds in a 103-100 overtime win over the Indiana Pacers. Though he was voted to play in the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, and selected to compete in the Three-Point Contest, due to a calf injury, Bosh was forced to withdraw from both. A blood clot in his leg again forced Bosh to miss time following the All-Star break. He faced increasing pressure from physicians and the Heat organization to sit out the rest of the season because of the potential dangers of the recurring medical condition. In September 2016, Bosh failed his physical exam with the Heat and was not cleared by the team to participate in training camp. Bosh was initially optimistic in a return to the Heat for the 2016-17 season, and the organization had become increasingly hopeful that he would be cleared for camp. That quickly changed, however, due to numerous setbacks accredited to continued blood clotting. On September 26, 2016, Heat president Pat Riley said that the team viewed Bosh's career with the team as over, and noted that the team was no longer working toward his return. On May 24, 2017, Bosh and the Heat reportedly reached a unique parting agreement in which he would leave the Heat without taking up their salary cap for the 2017-18 season. On June 2, 2017, the NBA ruled that Bosh's blood clotting issues were a career-ending illness, meaning the Miami Heat were able to remove his contract from their salary cap once they officially release him. On July 4, 2017, the Heat announced that they had waived Bosh, ending a seven-year stint with the organization. Out of respect, Heat president Pat Riley said following Bosh's release, \"The number '1' will never be worn by another player and we can't wait to someday hang his jersey in the rafters\". In November 2017, Bosh noted that he planned to \"keep [his] options open as a player\", and in February 2018, he declared himself on the comeback trail, having refused to rule out a return to the NBA.
