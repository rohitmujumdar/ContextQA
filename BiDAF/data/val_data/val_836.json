{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 2003, her self-titled fourth album was released on her new label, Capitol Records. Phair had not released an album in several years; she had been working on her record, as well as making guest appearances on other tracks (she lent backing vocals to the Sheryl Crow hit \"Soak Up the Sun\"). Initially, Phair worked on several album tracks with songwriter Michael Penn as the producer. When she submitted the finished Penn-produced album to Capitol, the label gave it a lukewarm reception and was unwilling to release it as submitted. Having already exhausted her recording budget, label president Andy Slater offered Phair more money to record only if Phair agreed to work with the production team known as The Matrix (best known as songwriters for Britney Spears and Avril Lavigne) to come up with some singles for the album. Phair's collaboration with the Matrix resulted in only four songs, but much of the media attention focused solely on the Matrix-produced tracks, which were a departure from her earlier work. The album received many negative reviews, especially from the independent music press, who accused Phair of \"selling out\" by making the record very pop-oriented. Liz Phair provoked a strong backlash from critics and disappointed fans of her earlier work. Many decried her for \"selling out\", and she became a \"pinata for critics.\" The New York Times' Meghan O'Rourke's review, titled \"Liz Phair's Exile in Avril-ville\", said that Phair \"gushes like a teenager\" and had \"committed an embarrassing form of career suicide.\" Somebody's Miracle, Phair's fifth album (and final album with Capitol Records), was released on October 4, 2005. The album returned to a more traditional rock sound, mixing the mood of Phair's earlier work with a more mellow sound. The album received mixed reviews and was not a chart success.
