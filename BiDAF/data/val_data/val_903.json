{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In gender division of labor, women are expected to be the homemaker even though some of them are the breadwinner at the same time. It is difficult for them to strike a balance between family and work. However, getting promoted is accompanied by more time devoted to workplace, which place women in disadvantage since they need to fulfill household responsibility as well. The situation might be even worse in finance and business industry where require longer working hours to handle fierce competition.Therefore, many women would give up senior positions to stay balance between family and workplace. Besides, a lot of people in Hong Kong still uphold the traditional gender ideology that men's status should always be superior than women's. According to the survey conducted by Women's Commission in 2010, 36.8% of female and 32.8% of male reported that patriarchal supremacy still exist in their family. In this case, the role of being female leader might possibly threaten their spouses' power in the relationship. In addition, there are also 46.1% of male and 32.3% of female agreed that male political leader would do much better than female. This gendered perception might possibly discourage women from competing higher positions with men. Moreover, glass ceiling also hinders women from reaching the top position. The job segregation by sex restrict women in certain types of job like clerical, which limit their work experience and thus making them harder to get promoted. Even though some women are capable enough to move upward, the old-boy network exclude women from decision-making.
