{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Tak Matsumoto, guitarist in Tetsuya Komuro's TM Network, had been extremely busy with various recording sessions and live performances. On 21 May 1988, Matsumoto released his first solo album, Thousand Wave. He saw this as the end of his solo career, and began his search for band members. He later met vocalist Koshi Inaba, who would later found B'z with him. At the time, Japan's music scene was loaded with many new bands being created. With all the digital sounds in mainstream music, the only sounds that they felt could not be expressed and replicated were the guitar and the human voice. As a result, they decided to keep it a two-man unit. On 21 September 1988, B'z made their debut with their first album, B'z, and single, \"Dakara Sono Te o Hanashite (dakarasonoShou woLi shite)\". Their music was very much a product of its times, with synthesizers and samplers sharing equal time with Matsumoto's guitar, producing an experimental sound, very different from their well-known hard rock sound of today. Instead of immediately performing live after a debut album, as many Japanese bands were doing, B'z chose to have a clear vision of how they wanted to perform and decided to wait until they had enough material to play for at least 90 minutes. The two concentrated on recording, raising the quality of their music. Their efforts resulted in a second album, Off the Lock, released on 21 May 1989. With this second album came their first series of live performances, known better to their fans as \"Live-Gym\". \"Live-Gym No. 00\" started in Nagoya, continuing into Osaka, and finished in Tokyo. Tickets were sold out on the day they became available. On 21 October, their first mini album, Bad Communication was released. The title track was a blend of rock and dance music, and is still a classic played during their \"Live-Gyms.\" It charted for 163 weeks on the Oricon Charts. Their first nationwide tour, B'z Live-Gym No. 001, covered 16 shows around Japan. On 21 February 1990, their third album Break Through was released. To promote it, they started a tour with 22 shows nationwide. Their single \"Taiyo no Komachi Angel\", was released on 13 June and peaked at No. 1 on the Oricon Chart. Every single since that release has debuted at No. 1 on the Oricon charts. Wicked Beat, their second mini album, was then released on 21 June. In contrast to the many promotional efforts for Break Through, Wicked Beat received little promotion and the duo went back to the studio and began recording. Their 4th album, Risky was released on 7 November and went platinum. Their \"Risky\" tour, totaling 49 performances, also started in November. Their first music video, Film Risky, was recorded in New York City and London within 4 weeks, and was released on 16 December. With a barrage of releases, 1990 came to be the busiest year for B'z.
