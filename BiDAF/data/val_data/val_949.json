{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Jack and Meg married on September 21, 1996 and divorced on March 24, 2000. In 2003, he had a brief relationship with actress Renee Zellweger, whom he met during the filming of Cold Mountain. That summer, the couple were in a car accident in which White broke his left index finger and was forced to reschedule much of the summer tour. He posted the footage of his finger surgery on the web for fans. White and Zellweger's breakup became public in December 2004. White met British model Karen Elson when she appeared in The White Stripes music video for \"Blue Orchid\". The video's director, Floria Sigismondi, noted \"you sensed an energy between them\". They married on June 1, 2005, in Manaus, Brazil. The wedding took place in a canoe on the Amazon River and was officiated by a shaman. A Roman Catholic priest later convalidated their marriage. Manager Ian Montone was the best man and Meg White was the maid of honor. Official wedding announcements stated that \"it was the first marriage\" for both. In 2006, the couple had a daughter Scarlett Teresa. Their second child, son Henry Lee, was born in 2007. The family resided in Brentwood, a suburb south of Nashville, where Elson managed a vintage clothing store called Venus & Mars. Elson provided vocals on White's first solo record. The couple announced their intention to divorce in June 2011, throwing \"a positive swing bang humdinger\" party to commemorate the split. On July 22, 2013, a Nashville judge barred White from having \"any contact with Karen Elson whatsoever except as it relates to parenting time with the parties' minor children.\" A counter-motion was filed on August 2, 2013, stating that \"The reason for filing this response is that Mr. White does not want to be portrayed as something he is not, violent toward his wife and children.\" The divorce was finalized on November 26, 2013. Elson later recanted the charges, attributing the \"aggressive\" proceedings to her divorce attorneys, and saying \"those who gain of a marriage ending helped to create a downward spiral at my most vulnerable.\" White agreed, saying, \"When shitty lawyers are in a situation like divorce, their goal is to villainize.\" The former couple reportedly remain on good terms.
