{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In the mid-1980s Chicago's interests \"shifted beyond 'issues of female identity' to an exploration of masculine power and powerlessness in the context of the Holocaust.\" Chicago's The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light (1985-93) is a collaboration with her husband, photographer Donald Woodman, whom she married on New Year's Eve 1985. Although Chicago's previous husbands were both Jewish, it wasn't until she met Woodman that she began to explore her own Jewish heritage. Chicago met poet Harvey Mudd, who had written an epic poem about the Holocaust. Chicago was interested in illustrating the poem, but decided to create her own work instead, using her own art, visual and written. Chicago worked alongside her husband to complete the piece, which took eight years to finish. The piece, which documents victims of the Holocaust, was created during a time of personal loss in Chicago's life: the death of her brother Ben, from Lou Gehrig's disease, and the death of her mother from cancer. Chicago used the tragic event of the Holocaust as a prism through which to explore victimization, oppression, injustice, and human cruelty. To seek inspiration for the project, Chicago and Woodman watched the documentary Shoah, which comprises interviews with Holocaust survivors at Nazi concentration camps and other relevant Holocaust sites. They also explored photo archives and written pieces about the Holocaust. They spent several months touring concentration camps and visited Israel. Chicago brought other issues into the work, such as environmentalism, Native American genocide, and the Vietnam War. With these subjects Chicago sought to relate contemporary issues to the moral dilemma behind the Holocaust. This aspect of the work caused controversy within the Jewish community, due to the comparison of the Holocaust to these other historical and contemporary concerns. The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light consists of sixteen large scale works made of a variety of mediums including: tapestry, stained glass, metal work, wood work, photography, painting, and the sewing of Audrey Cowan. The exhibit ends with a piece that displays a Jewish couple at Sabbath. The piece comprises 3000 square feet, providing a full exhibition experience for the viewer. The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light was exhibited for the first time in October 1993 at the Spertus Museum in Chicago. Most of the work from the piece is held at the Holocaust Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Over the next six years, Chicago created works that explored the experiences of concentration camp victims. Galit Mana of Jewish Renaissance magazine notes, \"This shift in focus led Chicago to work on other projects with an emphasis on Jewish tradition\", including Voices from the Song of Songs (1997), where Chicago \"introduces feminism and female sexuality into her representation of strong biblical female characters.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What was the Holocaust project?", "answers": [{"text": "Chicago's The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light (1985-93) is a collaboration with her husband, photographer Donald Woodman,", "answer_start": 170}, {"text": "\" Chicago's The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light (1985-93) is a collaboration with her husband, photographer Donald Woodman,", "answer_start": 168}, {"text": "consists of sixteen large scale works made of a variety of mediums including: tapestry, stained glass, metal work, wood work, photography, painting, and the sewing of Audrey Cowan.", "answer_start": 1931}, {"text": "In the mid-1980s Chicago's interests \"shifted beyond 'issues of female identity' to an exploration of masculine power and powerlessness in the context of the Holocaust.\" Chicago's The Holocaust Project:", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "a collaboration with her husband, photographer Donald Woodman, whom she married on New Year's Eve 1985.", "answer_start": 241}], "id": "C_455ea2e83dff42ada34789559bfce2d2_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "a collaboration with her husband, photographer Donald Woodman, whom she married on New Year's Eve 1985.", "answer_start": 241}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What was it all about?", "answers": [{"text": "\"shifted beyond 'issues of female identity' to an exploration of masculine power and powerlessness in the context of the Holocaust.\"", "answer_start": 37}, {"text": "documents victims of the Holocaust, was created during a time of personal loss in Chicago's life:", "answer_start": 806}, {"text": "consists of sixteen large scale works made of a variety of mediums including: tapestry, stained glass, metal work, wood work, photography, painting, and the sewing of Audrey Cowan.", "answer_start": 1931}, {"text": "an exploration of masculine power and powerlessness in the context of the Holocaust.", "answer_start": 84}, {"text": "The piece, which documents victims of the Holocaust, was created during a time of personal loss in Chicago's life:", "answer_start": 789}], "id": "C_455ea2e83dff42ada34789559bfce2d2_0_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "The piece, which documents victims of the Holocaust, was created during a time of personal loss in Chicago's life:", "answer_start": 789}}, {"followup": "m", "yesno": "y", "question": "Did she receive any recognition for this work?", "answers": [{"text": "The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light was exhibited for the first time in October 1993 at the Spertus Museum in Chicago.", "answer_start": 2277}, {"text": "was exhibited for the first time in October 1993 at the Spertus Museum in Chicago.", "answer_start": 2325}, {"text": "the work caused controversy within the Jewish community, due to the comparison of the Holocaust to these other historical and contemporary concerns.", "answer_start": 1734}, {"text": "Most of the work from the piece is held at the Holocaust Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.", "answer_start": 2408}], "id": "C_455ea2e83dff42ada34789559bfce2d2_0_q#2", "orig_answer": {"text": "Most of the work from the piece is held at the Holocaust Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.", "answer_start": 2408}}, {"followup": "n", "yesno": "x", "question": "How did her husband help?", "answers": [{"text": "it wasn't until she met Woodman that she began to explore her own Jewish heritage.", "answer_start": 400}, {"text": "it wasn't until she met Woodman that she began to explore her own Jewish heritage.", "answer_start": 400}, {"text": "They also explored photo archives and written pieces about the Holocaust.
