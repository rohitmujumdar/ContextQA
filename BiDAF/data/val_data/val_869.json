{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 1964, music producer Phil Spector came across the Righteous Brothers when they performed in a show at the Cow Palace in Daly City, where one of Spector's acts, The Ronettes, was also appearing. Spector was impressed enough to arrange a deal with Moonglow in early October 1964 which allowed Spector to record and release songs by the Righteous Brothers in the US, Canada and UK under his own label, Philles Records. Prior to this, all the songs Spector produced for Philles Records featured black singers; the Righteous Brothers would be his first white vocal group for the label, but they had a black vocal style, termed \"blue-eyed soul\", that suited Spector. Spector commissioned Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil to write a song for them, which turned out to be \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\". The song, released in late 1964, became their first major hit single and reached No. 1 in February 1965. Produced by Phil Spector, the record is often cited as one of the peak expressions of Spector's Wall of Sound production techniques. It is one of the most successful pop singles of its time, despite exceeding the then-standard length for radio play. Indeed, according to BMI, \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" is the most-played song on American radio and television of the 20th century, with more than eight million airplays by the end of 1999. The Righteous Brothers had several other hit singles with Philles Records in 1965, including \"Just Once in My Life\" and \"Unchained Melody\" (originally the B-side of \"Hung on You\"), both reaching the Billboard Top 10. \"Unchained Melody\" was produced by Medley; according to Medley, it was originally intended only as an album track, and Spector had asked him to produce the albums so Spector could spend time and money on producing singles. Later copies of the original 45 release credited Spector as producer when it became a hit. After the success of \"Unchained Melody\", Spector started recording older songs with the Righteous Brothers, including \"Ebb Tide\", which reached No. 5. Hatfield was the only vocal on \"Unchained Melody\" and \"Ebb Tide\", and both were songs Bobby Hatfield had performed with his first group, the Variations. According to Medley, both the early singles \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" and \"Just Once in My Life\" featured Medley's vocal strongly, which caused some friction between the duo, and the Hatfield solos in later singles restored some balance between the two. The last single released that they recorded with Philles Records was \"The White Cliffs of Dover\". Although Spector focused his attention in producing singles, a number of albums by the Righteous Brothers released with Philles Records sold well. In 1965, they had a couple of guest appearances in the films A Swingin' Summer and Beach Ball. They also became the first rock and roll act to play the Strip in Las Vegas (at The Sands).
