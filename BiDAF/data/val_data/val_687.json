{"paragraphs": [{"context": "The earliest controversy with Buffett was his recording of \"God's Own Drunk\" on the album Living and Dying in 3/4 Time. In 1983, the son of the late entertainer Lord Buckley sued Buffett for $11 million for copyright infringement, claiming that Buffett took parts of the monologue from Buckley's A Tribute to Buckley and claimed it as his own work in \"God's Own Drunk\". The suit also alleged that Buffett's \"blasphemous\" rendition presented to the public a distorted impression of Lord Buckley. A court injunction against Buffett prevented him from performing the song until the lawsuit was settled or resolved, so starting in 1983, Buffett would get to the part of his show where he would normally perform \"God's Own Drunk\", he would say that he was not allowed to play it because of the lawsuit and instead played a song he wrote called \"The Lawyer and the Asshole\" in which he accuses Buckley's son and lawyers as being greedy and tells them to \"kiss his ass.\" In January 1996, Buffett's Grumman HU-16 airplane named Hemisphere Dancer was shot at by Jamaican police, who believed the craft to be smuggling marijuana. The aircraft sustained minimal damage. The plane had previously been carrying Buffett, as well as U2's Bono, and Island Records producer Chris Blackwell, and co-pilot Bill Dindy, but they were not on board at the time. The Jamaican government acknowledged the mistake and apologized to Buffett, who penned the song \"Jamaica Mistaica\" for his Banana Wind album based on the experience. The plane from the incident is now at Orlando City Walk's Margaritaville. On February 4, 2001, he was ejected from the American Airlines Arena in Miami during a basketball game between the Miami Heat and the New York Knicks for cursing. After the game, referee Joe Forte said that he ordered him moved during the fourth quarter because \"there was a little boy sitting next to him and a lady sitting by him. He used some words he knows he shouldn't have used.\" Forte apparently did not know who Buffett was, and censured Heat coach Pat Riley because he thought Riley--who was trying to explain to him who Buffett was--was insulting him by asking if he had ever been a \"Parrothead\", the nickname for Buffett fans. Buffett did not comment immediately after the incident, but discussed it on The Today Show three days later. On October 6, 2006, it was reported that Buffett had been detained by French custom officials in Saint Tropez for allegedly carrying over 100 pills of ecstasy. Buffett's luggage was searched after his Dassault Falcon 900 private jet landed at Toulon-Hyeres International Airport. He paid a fine of $300 and was released. A spokesperson for Buffett stated the pills in question were prescription drugs, but declined to name the drug or the health problem for which he was being treated. Buffett released a statement that the \"ecstasy\" was in fact a B-vitamin supplement known as Foltx.
