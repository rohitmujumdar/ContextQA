{"paragraphs": [{"context": "On July 20, 2004, the Birthday Massacre again independently released an EP, Violet, and at the end of the year, re-released Nothing with new sleeve artwork. In the fall of 2004, Kai Schmidt, former member of electronic group Funker Vogt, signed the band to his label in Germany. They released a remastered and expanded LP version of Violet in Europe, including updated album art in a Digipak case. Adm left the band shortly before signing to Repo Records and can be seen in the original group photo on the nine song EP but is absent in the Digipak and LP version. In 2004, Brett Carruthers briefly joined the band on live keyboards. 2004 saw the band touring outside of Canada for the first time, playing the states of New York, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland performing with American bands 51 Peg, Deadstar Assembly, Celldweller and Crossbreed. In 2005, the band signed to Metropolis Records and re-released Violet. In August, the band began a series of international tours taking them to Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, Hungary, Czech Republic, Belgium, Spain and UK. Also in August the band released a DVD with the video for Blue by Dan Ouellette. Owen joined on keyboards first assuming the name Waffles, then O-en, then finally using his given name. Owen previously met the Birthday Massacre when playing in another band called Electric Knife Fight and joined just after the Blue filming was completed and therefore missed making an appearance in the video. On New Year's Eve the band performed in Los Angeles, California, at Bar Sinister. In early 2006, the Birthday Massacre toured North America, playing across Canada, the United States and Mexico on their \"Broken Minds\" tour sharing the stage with KMFDM, Schoolyard Heroes, Suicide City and the Start. They toured Europe again with bands Das Ich, Jesus on Extasy and Dope Stars Inc; playing in France, Italy, and Poland's Castle Party 2006. Through its European debut, Violet ranked high in the alternative charts. In several countries, the band made it onto the front pages of magazines; performing at some of Germany's largest music festivals, including the annual Highfeild and M'era Luna summer festivals. Also in 2006 the band recorded a remix of the song \"Straight to Video\" by Mindless Self Indulgence. Later in 2008, the band would record a second remix, this time of the song Never Wanted to Dance with the addition of Chibi's vocals.
