{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 1910, in a party led by Irving, Mallory and a friend attempted to climb Mont Velan in the Alps, but turned back shortly before the summit due to Mallory's altitude sickness. In 1911, Mallory climbed Mont Blanc, as well as making the third ascent of the Frontier ridge of Mont Maudit in a party again led by Irving. According to Helmut Dumler, Mallory was \"apparently prompted by a friend on the Western Front in 1916 [to write] a highly emotional article of his ascent of this great climb\"; this article was published as \"Mont Blanc from the Col du Geant by the Eastern Buttress of Mont Maudit\" in the Alpine Journal and contained his question, \"Have we vanquished an enemy?\" [i.e., the mountain] to which he responded, \"None but ourselves.\" By 1913, he had ascended Pillar Rock in the English Lake District, with no assistance, by what is now known as \"Mallory's Route\"--currently graded Hard Very Severe 5a (American grading 5.9). It is likely to have been the hardest route in Britain for many years. One of Mallory's closest friends and climbing companions was a young woman named Cottie Sanders, who became a novelist with the pseudonym of Ann Bridge. The nature of their relationship is elusive. She was a \"climbing friend\" or a \"casual sweetheart\". After Mallory died, Cottie wrote a memoir of him, which was never published, but nonetheless provided much of the material used by later biographers such as David Pye and David Robertson and a novel Everest Dream.

The pair were last seen when they were about 800 vertical feet (245 m) from the summit. Mallory's ultimate fate was unknown for 75 years, until his body was discovered on 1 May 1999 by an expedition that had set out to search for the climbers' remains.", "title": "George Mallory"}
