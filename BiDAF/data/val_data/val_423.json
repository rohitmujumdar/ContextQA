{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Yankovic changed his diet to become a vegan in 1992 after a former girlfriend gave him the book Diet for a New America and he felt \"it made ... a very compelling argument for a strict vegetarian diet\". When asked how he can \"rationalize\" performing at events such as the Great American Rib Cook-Off when he is a vegan, he replied, \"The same way I can rationalize playing at a college even though I'm not a student anymore.\" In a 2011 interview with news website OnMilwaukee, Yankovic clarified his stance on his diet, saying, \"I am still a vegetarian, and I try to be a vegan, but I occasionally cheat. If there's a cheese pizza on the band bus, I might sneak a piece.\" Yankovic married Suzanne Krajewski in 2001 after being introduced by their mutual friend Bill Mumy. Their daughter, Nina, was born in 2003. Yankovic identifies as Christian and has stated that a couple from his church appeared on the cover of Poodle Hat. Yankovic's religious background is reflected in his abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, drugs, and profanity. He and his family currently live in Los Angeles in a house previously owned at separate times by Jack S. Margolis and Heavy D. On April 9, 2004, Yankovic's parents were found dead in their Fallbrook, California home, the victims of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning from their fireplace. Several hours after his wife notified him of his parents' death, Yankovic went on with his concert in Appleton, Wisconsin, saying that \"since my music had helped many of my fans through tough times, maybe it would work for me as well\" and that it would \"at least ... give me a break from sobbing all the time.\" Their deaths occurred following the release of Poodle Hat, which was Yankovic's lowest-selling album in 20 years, but he considered continuing the show and tour therapeutic, saying \"if I didn't have anything to distract me, I probably would have spiraled into an even deeper depression. For a couple of hours each night, I could go onstage and put on a big fake smile and pretend like everything was just OK.\" In a 2014 interview, Yankovic called his parents' death \"the worst thing that ever happened to me.\" He added, \"I knew intellectually, that at some point, probably, I'd have to, you know, live through the death of my parents, but I never thought it would be at the same time, and so abruptly.\" Yankovic is well known for creating parodies of contemporary radio hits, typically which make up about half of his studio releases. Unlike other parody artists such as Allan Sherman, Yankovic and his band strive to keep the backing music in his parodies the same as the original, transcribing the original song by ear and re-recording the song for the parody. In some cases, in requesting the original band to allow for his parody, the band will offer to help out with the recreation: Dire Straits members Mark Knopfler and Guy Fletcher perform on \"Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*\", Yankovic's parody of Dire Straits' \"Money for Nothing\", while Imagine Dragons provided Yankovic with advice on how to recreate some of the electronic sounds they used for \"Radioactive\" in Yankovic's parody \"Inactive\". Yankovic's career in novelty and comedy music has outlasted many of his \"mainstream\" parody targets, such as Toni Basil, MC Hammer, and Men Without Hats. Yankovic's continued success (including the top 10 single \"White & Nerdy\" and album Straight Outta Lynwood in 2006) has enabled him to escape the one-hit wonder stigma often associated with novelty music. Although many of Yankovic's songs are parodies of contemporary radio hits, it is rare that the song's primary topic lampoons the original artist as a person, or the song itself. Most Yankovic songs consist of the original song's music, with a separate, unrelated set of amusing lyrics. Yankovic's humor normally lies more in creating unexpected incongruity between an artist's image and the topic of the song, contrasting the style of the song with its content (such as the songs \"Amish Paradise\", \"White & Nerdy\", and \"You're Pitiful\"), or in pointing out trends or works which have become pop culture cliches (such as \"eBay\" and \"Don't Download This Song\"). Yankovic's parodies are often satirical of popular culture, including television (see The TV Album), movies (\"The Saga Begins\"), and food (see The Food Album). Yankovic claims he has no intention of writing \"serious\" music. In his reasoning, \"There's enough people that do unfunny music. I'll leave the serious stuff to Paris Hilton and Kevin Federline.\" Yankovic considered that his first true satirical song was \"Smells Like Nirvana\", which references unintelligible lyrics in Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". Other satirical songs include \"Achy Breaky Song\", which refers to the song \"Achy Breaky Heart\", \"(This Song's Just) Six Words Long\", which refers to the repetitious lyrics in \"Got My Mind Set on You\", and \"Perform This Way\", set to Lady Gaga's \"Born This Way\" that drew inspiration from Lady Gaga's outlandish but confident attitude. Yankovic is the sole writer for all his songs and, for \"legal and personal reasons\", does not accept parody submissions or ideas from fans. There exists, however, one exception to this rule: Madonna was reportedly talking with a friend and happened to wonder aloud when Yankovic was going to turn her \"Like a Virgin\" into \"Like a Surgeon\". Madonna's friend was a mutual friend of Yankovic's manager, Jay Levey, and eventually Yankovic himself heard the story from Levey. One of Yankovic's most controversial parodies was 1996's \"Amish Paradise\", based on \"Gangsta's Paradise\" by hip-hop artist Coolio, which, in turn, was based on \"Pastime Paradise\" by Stevie Wonder. Reportedly, Coolio's label gave Yankovic the impression that Coolio had granted permission to record the parody, but Coolio maintains that he never did. While Coolio claimed he was upset, legal action never materialized, and Coolio accepted royalty payments for the song. After this controversy, Yankovic has always made sure to speak directly with the artist of every song he parodied. At the XM Satellite Radio booth at the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show Yankovic and Coolio made peace. On his website, Yankovic wrote of this event, \"I don't remember what we said to each other exactly, but it was all very friendly. I doubt I'll be invited to Coolio's next birthday party, but at least I can stop wearing that bulletproof vest to the mall.\" In an interview in 2014, Coolio extended his apology for refusing his permission, stating that at the time \"I was being cocky and shit and being stupid and I was wrong and I should've embraced that shit and went with it\", and that he considered Yankovic's parody \"actually funny as shit\". In 2000, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea told Behind the Music that he was unimpressed and disappointed by Yankovic's 1993 song \"Bedrock Anthem\", which parodied two of the band's songs. He was quoted as stating \"I didn't think it was very good. I enjoy Weird Al's things, but I found it unimaginative.\" For the Poodle Hat Al TV special, Yankovic raised the question of artistic expression in a fake interview with Eminem. As Yankovic has always done for his Al TV specials, he edited the footage of a previous Eminem interview and inserted himself asking questions for comic effect.
