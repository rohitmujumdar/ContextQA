{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 1957, Spahn was the ace of the champion Milwaukee Braves. Spahn pitched on two other Braves pennant winners, in 1948 and 1958. He had 2,583 strikeouts, which at the time of his retirement was the highest total for a left-handed pitcher in baseball history. Spahn led the NL in strikeouts for four consecutive seasons, from 1949 to 1952 (tied with Don Newcombe in 1951), which includes a single game high of 18 strike outs (then the NL record) in a 15-inning appearance on June 14, 1952. For several decades, Spahn's Hall of Fame plaque contained a typographical error, crediting him with 2,853 strikeouts. Spahn maintained that \"A pitcher needs two pitches -- one they're looking for, and one to cross 'em up.\" He was thus able to maintain his position as one of the game's top pitchers until his 19th season in the sport. This was exemplified by his start on July 2, 1963. Facing the San Francisco Giants, the 42-year-old Spahn became locked into a storied pitchers' duel with 25-year-old Juan Marichal. The score was still 0-0 after more than four hours when Willie Mays hit a game-winning solo home run off Spahn with one out in the bottom of the 16th inning. Marichal's manager, Alvin Dark, visited the mound in the 9th, 10th, 11th, 13th, and 14th innings, and was talked out of removing Marichal each time. During the 14th-inning visit, Marichal told Dark, \"Do you see that man pitching for the other side? Do you know that man is 42 years old? I'm only 25. If that man is on the mound, nobody is going to take me out of here.\" Marichal ended up throwing 227 pitches in the complete game 1-0 win, while Spahn threw 201 in the loss, allowing nine hits and one walk. Hall of Famer Carl Hubbell, who was in attendance that night, said of Spahn, \"He ought to will his body to medical science.\" Spahn threw his first no-hitter against the Phillies 16 September 1960, when he was 39. He pitched his second no-hitter the following year, 28 April 1961, against the Giants. By the last two seasons of his career, Spahn was the oldest active player in baseball. He lost this distinction for a single day: September 25, 1965, when 58-year-old Satchel Paige pitched three innings. Spahn's seemingly ageless ability caused Stan Musial famously to quip, \"[Spahn] will never get into the Hall of Fame. He won't stop pitching.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "how is warren linked to M Braves?", "answers": [{"text": "In 1957, Spahn was the ace of the champion Milwaukee Braves.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "In 1957, Spahn was the ace of the champion Milwaukee Braves.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "In 1957, Spahn was the ace of the champion Milwaukee Braves.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "In 1957, Spahn was the ace of the champion Milwaukee Braves.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Spahn was the ace of the champion Milwaukee Braves.", "answer_start": 9}], "id": "C_1414b94c9ce6403395477c822894acce_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "Spahn was the ace of the champion Milwaukee Braves.", "answer_start": 9}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "what remarkable things he did for the M braves?", "answers": [{"text": "He had 2,583 strikeouts, which at the time of his retirement was the highest total for a left-handed pitcher in baseball history.", "answer_start": 130}, {"text": "He had 2,583 strikeouts, which at the time of his retirement was the highest total for a left-handed pitcher in baseball history.", "answer_start": 130}, {"text": "He had 2,583 strikeouts, which at the time of his retirement was the highest total for a left-handed pitcher in baseball history.", "answer_start": 130}, {"text": "Spahn pitched on two other Braves pennant winners, in 1948 and 1958.", "answer_start": 61}, {"text": "He had 2,583 strikeouts, which at the time of his retirement was the highest total for a left-handed pitcher in baseball history.", "answer_start": 130}], "id": "C_1414b94c9ce6403395477c822894acce_0_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "He had 2,583 strikeouts, which at the time of his retirement was the highest total for a left-handed pitcher in baseball history.", "answer_start": 130}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "what more records did he create?", "answers": [{"text": "Spahn led the NL in strikeouts for four consecutive seasons, from 1949 to 1952 (tied with Don Newcombe in 1951),", "answer_start": 260}, {"text": "Spahn led the NL in strikeouts for four consecutive seasons, from 1949 to 1952 (", "answer_start": 260}, {"text": "Spahn led the NL in strikeouts for four consecutive seasons,", "answer_start": 260}, {"text": "Spahn led the NL in strikeouts for four consecutive seasons, from 1949 to 1952 (tied with Don Newcombe in 1951), which includes a single game high of 18 strike outs", "answer_start": 260}, {"text": "By the last two seasons of his career, Spahn was the oldest active player in baseball.", "answer_start": 1973}], "id": "C_1414b94c9ce6403395477c822894acce_0_q#2", "orig_answer": {"text": "By the last two seasons of his career, Spahn was the oldest active player in baseball.", "answer_start": 1973}}, {"followup": "n", "yesno": "y", "question": "did he achieve anything during these last two seasons?", "answers": [{"text": "Spahn threw his first no-hitter against the Phillies 16 September 1960, when he was 39.", "answer_start": 1798}, {"text": "By the last two seasons of his career, Spahn was the oldest active player in baseball.", "answer_start": 1973}, {"text": "Spahn's seemingly ageless ability caused Stan Musial famously to quip, \"[Spahn] will never get into the Hall of Fame.
