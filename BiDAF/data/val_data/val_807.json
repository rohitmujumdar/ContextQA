{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Forbes estimated Bundchen's 2016 income at $30.5 million. In August 2011, Bundchen ranked 60th on the Forbes list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women. She ranked third on The 20 Youngest Power Women of 2011 List at age 31. In 2011 Forbes named Bundchen and Brady as the World's Highest Paid Celebrity couple, beating Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie as well as Beyonce and Jay-Z. In August 2012 she was one of four people in the fashion industry and the only model to be ranked on the Forbes list of \"The World's Most Powerful Women\" at No. 83. She ranked in the top 10 of the Forbes list of \"Entertainment's Highest-Paid Women\" in 2012, at No. 8. In July 2007 Forbes named her the world's top-earning model. By 2008, she continued to dominate the Forbes list of the world's highest-earning models, and appeared on the magazine's list of the Top 20 Richest Women in Entertainment. During 2009-2010, she was the top earning supermodel. In 2010, she retained the top spot as Forbes's highest-earning model. In May 2011, Forbes ranked her as the world's top-earning model for the fifth consecutive time. Her earnings climbed over the previous year, thanks to an economic boom in Brazil, coupled with a 10 per cent surge in the value of the Brazilian real against the dollar. Also in 2013 she ranked No. 3 on the 16 most successful female entrepreneurs list by Forbes. Bundchen, however, disputes the number, telling WSJ. magazine in November 2013, \"Who are they speaking to when they come up with these numbers? Not my accountant, that's for sure.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "y", "question": "did he have tremendous wealth?", "answers": [{"text": "Forbes estimated Bundchen's 2016 income at $30.5 million.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Forbes named Bundchen and Brady as the World's Highest Paid Celebrity couple,", "answer_start": 234}, {"text": "Forbes estimated Bundchen's 2016 income at $30.5 million.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Forbes estimated Bundchen's 2016 income at $30.5 million.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Forbes estimated Bundchen's 2016 income at $30.5 million.", "answer_start": 0}], "id": "C_5fc5a96b8acb4ea8becdac7d34b9f057_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "Forbes estimated Bundchen's 2016 income at $30.5 million.", "answer_start": 0}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "y", "question": "was he happy with this/", "answers": [{"text": "Bundchen, however, disputes the number, telling WSJ. magazine in November 2013, \"Who are they speaking to when they come up with these numbers?
