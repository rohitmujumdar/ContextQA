{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Paulini was raised in a devout Christian family. She officially became an Australian citizen on 21 March 2013 at a special ceremony in Canberra that coincided with Harmony Day. Following years of struggling with her weight, Paulini showcased a new slimmer physique in 2014 after going from a size 16 to a size 10. She credits the weight loss to eating healthy, running, going to the gym, \"sleeping early and not staying up till late hours at night.\" Paulini is currently based in Sydney. In November 2014, she revealed that she was living with her sister Litia in a shared apartment in Matraville, New South Wales. Paulini is a supporter of the LGBTI community and has a gay following in Australia. Over the years, she has performed at many gay nightclubs and LGBTI-related events, including New York City Pride and the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. She told the Star Observer: \"the community has always been so good to me. They're the loudest and the ones right behind me.\" In June 2017, Paulini was charged with \"corruptly giving a benefit to an agent\", after she paid AU$850 to a Roads and Maritime Services (RMS) employee for a fake, NSW open driver licence, despite not being qualified to drive. Paulini's learner licence was suspended in March 2016 after she was caught driving unaccompanied and without L-plates displayed. She then spoke with an employee at a Mount Druitt RMS office in July 2016, who added an American driver licence number to Paulini's records and issued an open NSW licence for her. The employee had already been under investigation by police for distributing fake driver licences. Paulini pleaded guilty to the offence on 4 September 2017. She already had 11 driving offences, despite having only held a learner licence since 2002. On 15 December 2017, Paulini avoided jail time and was instead given a six-month suspended sentence. She has been placed on a good behaviour bond until 14 June 2018.
