{"paragraphs": [{"context": "The band recorded a cover of U2's song, \"Beautiful Day\", for the compilation album In the Name of Love: Artists United for Africa, which was released at the beginning of 2004. The track reached number 1 on R&R magazine's Christian rock chart in 2004, becoming their first chart-topping single. \"Beautiful Day\" also received a GMA Dove Award nomination for Modern Rock Song of the Year in 2004. The band also did a cover of the song \"Promised Land\" for the 2004 album Veggie Rocks. In February 2004, the band went back in studio to record their second album; almost all of its tracks were written the previous month. It was recorded in six weeks with producer Tedd T, and soon released under the title Fight the Tide in June 2004. The lead single \"Everything About You\" was released in mid-2004, and by September it had stayed at number 1 on R&R's Christian rock chart for six consecutive weeks. The song was later featured on the X 2006 compilation album in 2005. In September 2004, Sanctus Real launched their first headlining tour, the Fight the Tide Tour. The tour featured guest bands Hawk Nelson, Seven Places and Ever Stays Red, and traveled through more than 25 cities. After being nominated in late 2004, Fight the Tide won the GMA Dove Award for \"Modern Rock Album of the Year\" in early 2005. Released near the beginning of the year, \"The Fight Song\" was Sanctus Real's next single, and in May 2005 it reached the top of R&R's Christian rock chart, becoming the band's third number 1 song. In April 2005, bass player Steve Goodrum left the band and was replaced by Dan Gartley, a previous touring member of Relient K. Gartley played his first concert with Sanctus Real at the Agape Festival in May 2005.
