{"paragraphs": [{"context": "At the age of 25, Clift moved to Hollywood. His first movie role was opposite John Wayne in Red River, which was shot in 1946 and released in 1948. His second movie was The Search. Clift was unhappy with the quality of the script, and edited it himself. The movie was awarded a screenwriting Academy Award for the credited writers. Clift's naturalistic performance led to director Fred Zinnemann's being asked, \"Where did you find a soldier who can act so well?\", and he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. Clift signed on for his next movie, 1949's The Heiress, in order to avoid being typecast. Clift was unhappy with the script, and unable to get along with most of the cast. He criticized co-star Olivia de Havilland, saying that she let the director shape her entire performance and telling friends that he wanted to change de Havilland's lines because \"She isn't giving me enough to respond [to]\". The studio marketed Clift as a sex symbol prior to the movie's release in 1949. Clift had a large female following, and Olivia de Havilland was flooded with angry fan letters because her character rejects Clift's character in the final scene of the movie. Clift ended up unhappy with his performance, and left early during the film's premiere. Clift also starred in The Big Lift, which was shot on location in Germany in 1949. Clift's performance in 1951's A Place in the Sun is regarded as one of his signature method acting performances. He worked extensively on his character, and was again nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. For his character's scenes in jail, Clift spent a night in a real state prison. He also refused to go along with director George Stevens' suggestion that he do \"something amazing\" on his character's walk to the electric chair. Instead, he walked to his death with a natural, depressed facial expression. His main acting rival (and fellow Omaha, Nebraska, native), Marlon Brando, was so moved by Clift's performance that he voted for Clift to win the Academy Award for Best Actor, and was sure that he would win. That year, Clift voted for Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire. A Place in the Sun was critically acclaimed; Charlie Chaplin called it \"the greatest movie made about America\". The film received added media attention due to the rumors that Clift and co-star Elizabeth Taylor were dating in real life. They were billed as \"the most beautiful couple in Hollywood\". Many critics still call Clift and Taylor \"the most beautiful Hollywood movie couple of all time\". After an almost two-year break, in the summer of 1952, Clift committed himself to three more films: I Confess, to be directed by Alfred Hitchcock; Vittorio De Sica's Terminal Station; and Fred Zinnemann's From Here to Eternity, which earned Clift his third Oscar nomination. Clift was notoriously picky with his projects. According to Taylor (as quoted in Patricia Bosworth's biography of Clift), \"Monty could've been the biggest star in the world if he did more movies.\" Clift reportedly turned down the starring role in East of Eden, just as he had for Sunset Boulevard.
