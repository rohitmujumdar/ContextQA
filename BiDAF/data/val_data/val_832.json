{"paragraphs": [{"context": "\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" marked the first collaboration between rapper Jay-Z and R&B singer Beyonce. While listening to Shakur's The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory, producer Kanye West suggested that American rapper Tupac Shakur's song \"Me and My Girlfriend\" would make a good sample to use on Jay-Z's duet with Beyonce. West told MTV News that Jay-Z had asked him on the telephone for a duet for him and Beyonce: \"We got this joint, it has to be the best beat you ever made.\" He continued: So I went home and called my dog, E Base, who plays a lot of instruments up at Baseline [studio] for me and [producer] Just Blaze. [E] came through. I programmed the drums in 10 minutes, and then he played all the different parts. This version is all live bass, live guitars, [live] chords on it. I brought it to Hov that night, he heard it, he thought of the video treatment before he thought of the rap. He just knew it was gonna be the one. Tensions arose during the conception of \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" over the sampling of \"Me and My Girlfriend. Senior Vice President of A&R Tina Davis commented on the issue, \"We only had one day to clear the [Tupac Shakur] sample [from 'Me and my Girlfriend'] that was used on ''03 Bonnie and Clyde' last year with Jay-Z and Beyonce [Beyonce]. We were back and forth with Afeni Shakur all day until we got the clearance. And then it's a hit.\" \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" was released on October 10, 2002, as the lead single from Jay-Z's album The Blueprint2: The Gift & the Curse. Beyonce later included the song as a bonus track on international editions of her 2003 debut solo album Dangerously in Love. In 2003, Now That's What I Call Music! included \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" as the opening track of the 12th volume of the US release and the fifteenth track of the 54th volume of the UK release. The song's release was the first indication of Jay-Z's and Beyonce's romantic status, spawning rumors about a burgeoning relationship. Their relationship was not made public until Jay-Z featured on Beyonce's songs \"Crazy In Love\" (2003) and \"Deja Vu\" (2006). It was later announced that they had been dating since recording \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\". The latter's release also marked the debut of the solo career of Beyonce, leaving Destiny's Child on hiatus.
