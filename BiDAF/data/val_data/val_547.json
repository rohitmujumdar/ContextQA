{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Medley also had a moderately successful solo career. In 1968, Medley first recorded \"I Can't Make It Alone\" written by Carole King, but the song failed to make much of an impact. The following singles, \"Brown Eyed Woman\" written by Mann and Weil, and \"Peace, Brother, Peace\", both performed better and were Top 40 Pop hits. In 1969, he won 2nd place at the Festival Internacional da Cancao (FIC) in Rio de Janeiro, with the song \"Evie\", by Jimmy Webb. Medley performed \"Hey Jude\" at the 1969 Grammy Awards, and was then signed to A&M Records which released a number of his records. One of his recordings, \"Freedom and Fear\" from Michel Colombier's album Wings, was nominated for a Grammy in 1972. Medley released several solo albums during the 1970s and 1980s, and enjoyed a resurgence in his career in the 1980s. He released an album, Sweet Thunder in 1980, containing a version of Don't Know Much, which was originally written and performed by Barry Mann the same year. He signed with Planet Records in 1982 and later with RCA Records. In 1984 and 1985, he charted 5 singles on the country charts with the biggest of these being the Top 20 country hit, \"I Still Do,\" which also crossed over to the adult contemporary charts and later became a \"cult\" hit with the Carolina Beach/Shag dance club circuit. One of Medley's minor entries, \"All I Need to Know\" was later recorded as \"Don't Know Much\" by Grammy-winning duet Linda Ronstadt and Aaron Neville was a long running No. 2 Hot 100 and No. 1 Adult Contemporary in 1989-90. In 1987 his duet with Jennifer Warnes, \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\", was included on the Dirty Dancing soundtrack album, and the single reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The song won Medley and Warnes a 1988 Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and an Academy Award for Best Original Song for the composers. \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\" is now seen and heard ubiquitously on TV and radio commercials -- covered by singers other than Medley and Warnes -- usually connected with vacation, cruise, resort, and other such holiday-themed advertisers. Among his other notable songs are \"Most of All You\", the closing theme to the movie Major League; \"Friday Night's A Great Night For Football\" from Tony Scott's movie, The Last Boy Scout; and the theme song for the Growing Pains spinoff, Just The Ten of Us. He also collaborated with Giorgio Moroder and scored a moderate UK hit in 1988 with a version of \"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother.\" Medley recorded a video for the song which was also used as the end credit theme for Rambo III. Bill Medley continues to perform solo after Bobby Hatfield's death in 2003.
