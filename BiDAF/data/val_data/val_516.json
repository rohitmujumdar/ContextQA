{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Petty was found unconscious at his home, not breathing and in full cardiac arrest, early in the morning of October 2, 2017. He was taken to the UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica, California, where he died at 8:40 pm PDT that evening. After reports of Petty's hospitalization, premature reports of his death spread quickly and widely, and without official denial or confirmation, continued throughout the day until the band's management issued official confirmation shortly after Petty's actual death Monday evening. While the official announcement said Petty collapsed early Monday morning, original reports claimed the incident happened Sunday night. Petty's funeral took place at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery on October 16, 2017. On January 19, 2018, the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner announced that Petty had died from an accidental overdose of prescription pain medication, and that the autopsy had found a number of drugs in his system: fentanyl, oxycodone, acetylfentanyl and despropionyl fentanyl (all opioids, two illegal fentanyl analogs); temazepam and alprazolam (both sedatives); and citalopram (an antidepressant). In a statement on his official website, Petty's family revealed that he had suffered from multiple medical problems; those medical problems included emphysema, knee difficulties, and a hip fracture that occurred on Petty's final tour. Petty was prescribed pain medication for these issues. The statement, which was signed by Petty's wife Dana and daughter Adria, noted that Petty was informed on the day of his death that his fractured hip had graduated to a full break; the statement read, in part, that \"[it] is our feeling that the pain was simply unbearable and was the cause for his over use of medication.[..] We feel confident that this was, as the coroner found, an unfortunate accident.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "when did he die?", "answers": [{"text": "October 2, 2017.", "answer_start": 107}, {"text": "October 2, 2017.", "answer_start": 107}, {"text": "early in the morning of October 2, 2017.", "answer_start": 83}, {"text": "October 2, 2017.", "answer_start": 107}], "id": "C_98439b45914b420e81bef99afb657b71_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "October 2, 2017.", "answer_start": 107}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "how did he die?", "answers": [{"text": "accidental overdose of prescription pain medication,", "answer_start": 866}, {"text": "accidental overdose of prescription pain medication,", "answer_start": 866}, {"text": "full cardiac arrest,", "answer_start": 62}, {"text": "an accidental overdose of prescription pain medication,", "answer_start": 863}, {"text": "full cardiac arrest,", "answer_start": 62}], "id": "C_98439b45914b420e81bef99afb657b71_0_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "full cardiac arrest,", "answer_start": 62}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "where did he die?", "answers": [{"text": "UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica, California,", "answer_start": 144}, {"text": "at his home,", "answer_start": 28}, {"text": "UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica,", "answer_start": 144}, {"text": "at his home,", "answer_start": 28}, {"text": "Santa Monica, California,", "answer_start": 167}], "id": "C_98439b45914b420e81bef99afb657b71_0_q#2", "orig_answer": {"text": "Santa Monica, California,", "answer_start": 167}}, {"followup": "m", "yesno": "x", "question": "how old was he?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1866}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1866}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1866}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1866}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1866}], "id": "C_98439b45914b420e81bef99afb657b71_0_q#3", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1866}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "n", "question": "was he at home when he died?", "answers": [{"text": "He was taken to the UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica, California, where he died at 8:40 pm PDT that evening.", "answer_start": 124}, {"text": "Petty was found unconscious at his home, not breathing and in full cardiac arrest,", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "UCLA Medical Center", "answer_start": 144}, {"text": "the UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica, California, where he died at 8:40 pm PDT that evening.", "answer_start": 140}, {"text": "He was taken to the UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica, California, where he died", "answer_start": 124}], "id": "C_98439b45914b420e81bef99afb657b71_0_q#4", "orig_answer": {"text": "He was taken to the UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica, California, where he died", "answer_start": 124}}, {"followup": "m", "yesno": "y", "question": "Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?", "answers": [{"text": "Petty's funeral took place at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery on October 16, 2017.", "answer_start": 654}, {"text": "Petty was informed on the day of his death that his fractured hip had graduated to a full break;", "answer_start": 1543}, {"text": "that Petty had died from an accidental overdose of prescription pain medication,", "answer_start": 838}, {"text": "the autopsy had found a number of drugs in his system: fentanyl, oxycodone, acetylfentanyl and despropionyl fentanyl (all opioids, two illegal fentanyl analogs);
