{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Although known primarily for R&B, g.o.d has often displayed their versatility as their albums feature songs which combine elements of different genres such as hip hop, rap, funk and dance pop: their debut single \"To Mother\" (eomeonimgge) contains elements of hip hop and a refrain sung in R&B style, the upbeat and rhythmic \"Friday Night\" from the second album heavily features funk elements and the ballad \"The Story of Our Lives\" from the most recent album utilizes a \"duet\" of the rap and singing parts in the chorus to create a polyphonic texture. Park Joon-hyung has stated that from the beginning he had intended for the group to effectively combine Western and Asian influences into their music. They were one of the few first generation K-pop groups to successfully incorporate elements of African American genres such as rap and hip hop into their music and utilize lines rapped entirely in Korean, which was uncommon at that time. While each song differs in genre, a key characteristic is a prominently distinct and simple melody which is accompanied by a minimalistic piano, guitar or percussion-based groove. Their overall style has been described as a mixture of \"belting styles\" with \"gentle rap, candid lyrics and plain vocal narration\". Their ability to seamlessly transition between rap and R&B is apparent in their hit songs, most of which are classified as R&B ballads or pop but contain at least several lines that are rapped. This combination of a prominent lyrical melody and rap has been described as their \"signature\". Some songs feature a spoken narration to introduce the song. They have shied away from trending genres such as bubblegum pop and electronic music. In contrast to their contemporaries such as Shinhwa, H.O.T. and Sechs Kies whose repertoire was largely either \"feel-good\" or hard rock or was choreography-based, g.o.d was focused on lyrical content, garnering them a wider demographic of fans. The trademark features of their repertoire are the \"story telling\" style and subject matter of their lyrics. MTV Asia describes their songs as \"[leaning] towards the social commentary side, with heartfelt lyrics that make people cry until today.\" Their songs often reflected relatable themes such as love, loss and family or were based on their personal experiences: their debut single \"To Mother\" was partly based on leader Park Joon-hyung's childhood while \"The Story of Five Men\" (daseos namja iyagi) described their frugal living conditions during their first year as struggling young singers. Other songs are more humorous and parodied the members themselves, such as the self-composed \"Sky Blue Balloon\" (haneulsaeg pungseon), in which rapper Danny Ahn refers to himself by his nickname Skinny Pig. Critics and media have noted the group's unique blend of five distinctly different voices. Mnet's Legends 100 series noted that \"[The] synergy created by these five people began a page of popular music history that has never been seen before.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What is the group's musical style?", "answers": [{"text": "a key characteristic is a prominently distinct and simple melody which is accompanied by a minimalistic", "answer_start": 975}, {"text": "known primarily for R&B,", "answer_start": 9}, {"text": "known primarily for R&B, g.o.d has often displayed their versatility as their albums feature songs which combine elements of different genres such as hip hop, rap, funk and dance pop:", "answer_start": 9}, {"text": "Their overall style has been described as a mixture of \"belting styles\" with \"gentle rap, candid lyrics and plain vocal narration", "answer_start": 1121}, {"text": "known primarily for R&B, g.o.d has often displayed their versatility as their albums feature songs which combine elements of different genres", "answer_start": 9}], "id": "C_93e374793eeb499582f2c841878ae88d_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "known primarily for R&B, g.o.d has often displayed their versatility as their albums feature songs which combine elements of different genres", "answer_start": 9}}, {"followup": "m", "yesno": "x", "question": "What kinds of elements do they use?", "answers": [{"text": "Their overall style has been described as a mixture of \"belting styles\" with \"gentle rap, candid lyrics and plain vocal narration\".", "answer_start": 1121}, {"text": "second album heavily features funk elements", "answer_start": 348}, {"text": "such as hip hop, rap, funk and dance pop: their debut single \"To Mother\" (eomeonimgge) contains elements of hip hop and a refrain sung in R&B style,", "answer_start": 151}, {"text": "their albums feature songs which combine elements of different genres such as hip hop, rap, funk and dance pop:", "answer_start": 81}, {"text": "their debut single \"To Mother\" (eomeonimgge) contains elements of hip hop and a refrain sung in R&B style,", "answer_start": 193}], "id": "C_93e374793eeb499582f2c841878ae88d_0_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "their debut single \"To Mother\" (eomeonimgge) contains elements of hip hop and a refrain sung in R&B style,", "answer_start": 193}}, {"followup": "m", "yesno": "y", "question": "Are there any other different elements they have used?", "answers": [{"text": "seamlessly transition between rap and R&B is apparent in their hit songs,", "answer_start": 1270}, {"text": "g.o.d was focused on lyrical content, garnering them a wider demographic of fans.", "answer_start": 1853}, {"text": "\"Friday Night\" from the second album heavily features funk elements", "answer_start": 324}, {"text": "They were one of the few first generation K-pop groups to successfully incorporate elements of African American genres such as rap", "answer_start": 703}, {"text": "the upbeat and rhythmic \"Friday Night\" from the second album heavily features funk elements and the ballad", "answer_start": 300}], "id": "C_93e374793eeb499582f2c841878ae88d_0_q#2", "orig_answer": {"text": "the upbeat and rhythmic \"Friday Night\" from the second album heavily features funk elements and the ballad", "answer_start": 300}}, {"followup": "m", "yesno": "y", "question": "Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?", "answers": [{"text": "In contrast to their contemporaries such as Shinhwa, H.O.T. and Sechs Kies whose repertoire was largely either \"feel-good\" or hard rock or was choreography-based,", "answer_start": 1690}, {"text": "Critics and media have noted the group's unique blend of five distinctly different voices.", "answer_start": 2740}, {"text": "\".
