{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In November 2008, Chamillionaire announced his plans for his third album, Venom, for release in early 2009. His sixth installment in the Mixtape Messiah series was to be a \"prelude\" to Venom. The first single from Venom was initially planned to be \"Creepin' (Solo)\", which featured Ludacris and ended up reaching #1 on the Billboard Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop Singles chart. However, it is unclear whether or not the song will be included on Venom after Chamillionaire canceled and then reinstated the album. He announced that Mixtape Messiah 7 would be the final installment of the \"Mixtape Messiah\" series and that he cancelled Venom to create different material for his third album. Chamillionaire awarded his final Mixtape Messiah 7 to 100 winners of a contest which he ran on his website. The first disc from Mixtape Messiah 7 was launched for free download on August 4, 2009, just after 11:30 pm EST, while Disc 2 was released on August 6, 2009, just after 2:00 am EST. The next day the next Disc 3 & 4 dropped making it a 66 track compilation. On September 29, it was officially announced that Chamillionaire's third album would indeed be entitled Venom after a fan vote on his Web site. The first single from this upcoming album is titled \"Good Morning\". The album was scheduled to be released on June 22, 2010. Chamillionaire appeared on the remix for Weezer's song \"Can't Stop Partying\", from their album Raditude. He also joined Weezer for live performances as Lil Wayne, who is featured on the original version of the track, was convicted on gun possession charges and was unable to perform. On December 11, 2009, Chamillionaire performed a set for \"Fort Hood Community Strong\", an event described as a day of \"healing, fun and entertainment\" for those placed at the Fort Hood military base who were affected by the shooting that took place on November 5, 2009, killing 13 people. Other performers at the event included Nick Jonas, Dana Carvey and Zac Brown Band. On December 23, 2009, Chamillionaire announced via his YouTube page that he would be initiating a new mixtape series entitled \"Major Pain\" through his website by dropping a disc entitled Major Pain on February 2, 2010. Due to the 2010 NBA All-Star Game taking place in Dallas, Texas, Chamillionaire released a new song, \"The Main Event\", on February 11, 2010, via free download. It features fellow Texas rappers Paul Wall, Slim Thug & Dorrough. \"Every artist on the song with me has independent hustle and strength in the streets,\" he said. \"It's an All-Star song, so what better place to shoot the video than All-Star Weekend, right here in our own backyard.\" It was later released to iTunes on June 8, 2010. On Chamillionaire's official website, he stated \"Right now the Venom album is set for March 16 and has been pushed back just like Lil Wayne's Rebirth, Game's Red album, and countless other hip hop albums that this happens to.\" The date was later pushed back to June 22, but was not released that day. Venom has been confirmed as cancelled as Chamillionaire has parted ways with Universal.
