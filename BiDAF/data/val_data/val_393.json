{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Born in 718 to Azdi parents of modest means, al-Farahidi was from southern Arabia (modern day Oman). He later moved to Basra, Iraq in his youth. Originally of the Ibadi sect of Islam, the claim he became Sunni is unsubstantiated. He was one of the companions of Jabir ibn Zayd, the founder of ibadism. He is said to have lived a simple and pious life in Iraq; It was said his parents were converts to Islam, and that his father was the first to be named \"Ahmad\" after the time of Prophet Muhammad. His nickname, \"Farahidi\", differed from his tribal name and derived from an ancestor named Furhud (Young Lion); plural farahid. The descendants of his tribe are the modern-day Zahran tribe residing primarily in the Al Bahah Province of Saudi Arabia. While in Basra, he was a student of Abu 'Amr ibn al-'Ala'. Al-Farahidi notoriously refused lavish gifts from rulers, or to sink to malicious slander or rumor-mongering against intellectual rivals, unlike many of his contemporary Arab and Persian men of letters,. While in Basra, he made a living as a language teacher. He was said to have lived a pious and simple life, performing the pilgrimage to Mecca almost every year. Al-Farahidi lived in a small house made of reeds and once remarked that once he shut his door, his mind did not go beyond it. Although some of his students amassed wealth through their own teaching, most of al-Farahidi's income was from falconry and a garden he inherited from his father. Al-Farahidi's date of death has been listed as both 786 and 791 CE. His preoccupation with deep thoughts led to his death. It is said that one day, al-Farahidi was attempting to work out an accounting system in his head which would save his maidservant from being cheated out of money by a green grocer; he then absent-mindedly bumped into a pillar of a mosque he had wandered into and sustained a fatal fall.
