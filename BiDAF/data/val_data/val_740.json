{"paragraphs": [{"context": "On the success of \"Babe\", DeYoung began pushing for a more theatrical direction, while Shaw and Young favored a harder-edged approach. This arguing over musical direction led to a bit of tension in early 1980 after Young and Shaw objected to the ballad \"First Time\" released as the second single from Cornerstone (1979) album. However, things were quickly smoothed over. Moreover, this song did not chart in the U.S. but became a huge hit single in the Philippines in 1981. In January 1981, Styx released Paradise Theatre, a concept album that became their biggest hit, reaching No. 1 on the Billboard pop albums chart and yielding five singles, including the top ten hits \"The Best of Times\" by DeYoung (#3) and \"Too Much Time on My Hands\" by Shaw (#9). Paradise Theatre became the band's fourth consecutive multi-platinum album. The band was accused by a California religious group and later the Parents Music Resource Center of backmasking Satanic messages in their anti-cocaine anthem, \"Snowblind\". James Young has denied this charge during his introduction for \"Snowblind\" when played live. Dennis DeYoung has denied the accusation as well, joking on the In the Studio with Redbeard program \"we had enough trouble to make the music sound right forward.\" Also, James Young quotes, \"If we were going to put something Satanic in our songs, we would have put it so it was in the song forward. Not so you would have to buy some $400 tape recorder to hear it.\" Throughout the 1980s, the band would use the Paradise Theatre (1981) album's opening track, \"Rockin' the Paradise\" (charted at No. 8 on Top Rock Tracks Chart) to open their shows.
