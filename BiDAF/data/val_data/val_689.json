{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 2003, Rob Hotchkiss left the band citing creative differences. According to band interviews, Hotchkiss resented being pushed away as a songwriter and decided to leave. Hotchkiss started pursuing a solo career, after having contributed to six of the 11 songs on the (at the time) upcoming album My Private Nation. His solo album, the critically acclaimed Midnight Ghost, was released in 2004. The band's third album, My Private Nation, was released in June 2003 with \"Calling All Angels\" as the lead single. \"Calling All Angels\" became Train's third top 20 hit, and was a major hit on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. \"Calling All Angels\" has been certified RIAA Gold. In October 2003, bassist Charlie Colin was forced to leave the band because of substance abuse. According to singer Pat Monahan, Colin was \"a mess\". After a live presentation in Oregon, he called an emergency meeting and told the band that \"you can have your bass player, or you can have your singer\". In 2004, their non-album song \"Ordinary\" was featured in the movie Spider-Man 2. In 2007, it was featured again, this time in the NBC series Heroes. The music video for \"Ordinary\" was in rotation on MTV, but the song only charted on the Adult Top 40 Tracks chart. In July 2005, after the song was featured in an advertising campaign for Cingular, the band released \"Get to Me\" as the final single from My Private Nation. \"Get to Me\" (written by Rob Hotchkiss and Pat Monahan) reached number nine on the Billboard Adult Top 40. Paul Buckmaster returned on \"My Private Nation\" with string arrangements for the tracks \"Lincoln Avenue\" and \"Your Every Color\". The album was certified platinum by the RIAA. The band released their first live album, Alive at Last, in 2004, later winning a Radio Music Award for best artist.
