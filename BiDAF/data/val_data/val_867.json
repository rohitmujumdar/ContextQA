{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Pleasonton was promoted on June 22, 1863 to Major General of U.S. Volunteers. On June 29, after consulting with his new commander, George Meade, Pleasanton began replacing political generals with \"commanders who were prepared to fight, to personally lead mounted attacks\". He found just the kind of aggressive fighters he wanted in three of his aides: Wesley Merritt, Elon J. Farnsworth (both of whom had command experience) and George A. Custer. All received immediate promotions; Custer to brigadier general of volunteers, commanding the Michigan Cavalry Brigade (\"Wolverines\"). Despite having no direct command experience, Custer became one of the youngest generals in the Union Army at age 23. Custer lost no time in implanting his aggressive character on his brigade, part of the division of Brigadier General Judson Kilpatrick. Now a general officer, Custer had great latitude in choosing his uniform. Though often criticized as gaudy, it was more than personal vanity. \"A showy uniform for Custer was one of command presence on the battlefield: he wanted to be readily distinguishable at first glance from all other soldiers. He intended to lead from the front, and to him it was a crucial issue of unit morale that his men be able to look up in the middle of a charge, or at any other time on the battlefield, and instantly see him leading the way into danger.\" Some have claimed Custer's leadership in battle as reckless or foolhardy. However, he \"meticulously scouted every battlefield, gauged the enemies [sic] weak points and strengths, ascertained the best line of attack and only after he was satisfied was the 'Custer Dash' with a Michigan yell focused with complete surprise on the enemy in routing them every time.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What is the brigade command?", "answers": [{"text": "Pleasonton was promoted on June 22, 1863 to Major General of U.S. Volunteers.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Custer to brigadier general of volunteers, commanding the Michigan Cavalry Brigade (\"Wolverines\").", "answer_start": 482}, {"text": "Custer to brigadier general of volunteers, commanding the Michigan Cavalry Brigade (\"Wolverines\").", "answer_start": 482}, {"text": "Pleasonton was promoted on June 22, 1863 to Major General of U.S. Volunteers.
