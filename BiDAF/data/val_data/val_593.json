{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In January 2011, the New York Post reported that Barbra Streisand was in negotiations to produce, direct and star in a new film version of Gypsy. In an interview with the New York Post, Arthur Laurents said, \"We've talked about it a lot, and she knows what she's doing. She has my approval.\" He said that he would not write the screenplay. In a clarifying statement and report, The New York Times wrote that Streisand would star, but would not produce or direct. Streisand's spokesperson confirmed that \"there have been conversations\". However, Frank Rizzo of courant.com reported on March 12, 2011 that the film with Streisand \"is not going to happen, according to playwright-director Arthur Laurents, one of the rights holders to the work.\" But that was contradicted by an August 2011 report by USA TODAY that the plans for a film adaptation of Gypsy were still intact. \"Before writer and director Arthur Laurents died at age 93 last May, there had been much talk about a movie version of Gypsy starring Streisand as Rose. 'We just have to find our team and a writer,' said Streisand. 'It's too bad, because I was looking forward to working with Arthur,' who directed Streisand in her Broadway debut. 'I had seen him a few months before that, and he seemed so strong and healthy.'\" In March 2012, reports stated that Universal Pictures was pressing on with the new film. Streisand was still attached to produce and play Rose, with Joel Silver co-producing and Julian Fellowes scripting. Playbill reported in October 2015 that \"Universal, which had been working with Streisand on the project, formally put Gypsy in turnaround, meaning it has decided not to develop the film any further. Streisand reportedly has been working with producer Joel Silver on the project, and they are now free to shop their Gypsy around to other studios.\" In April 2016, it was reported that Streisand was in advanced negotiations to star in and produce the film, which will be directed by Barry Levinson and distributed by STX Entertainment. In July 2016, it was reported that Richard LaGravenese had finished writing the script for the film and that production for the film is aiming to begin in early 2017. However, on August 3, 2016, it was reported that STX Entertainment \"was withdrawing as distributor and co-financier of the film.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What was Barbra's involvement with Gypsy?", "answers": [{"text": "Barbra Streisand was in negotiations to produce, direct and star in a new film version of Gypsy.", "answer_start": 49}, {"text": "In January 2011, the New York Post reported that Barbra Streisand was in negotiations to produce, direct and star in a new film version of Gypsy.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "In January 2011, the New York Post reported that Barbra Streisand was in negotiations to produce, direct and star in a new film version of Gypsy.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Streisand was still attached to produce and play Rose,", "answer_start": 1373}, {"text": "Barbra Streisand was in negotiations to produce, direct and star in a new film version of Gypsy.", "answer_start": 49}], "id": "C_38c3ca559a1e4d289ff9efce9c06e333_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "Barbra Streisand was in negotiations to produce, direct and star in a new film version of Gypsy.", "answer_start": 49}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "y", "question": "Did she want this role?", "answers": [{"text": "The New York Times wrote that Streisand would star, but would not produce or direct.", "answer_start": 378}, {"text": "said Streisand.
