{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In January 2005 Lindsay McDougall and Whalley took over as hosts of national youth radio station, Triple J's Breakfast Show, under the name, Jay and the Doctor. New radio skits included Space Goat and Battalion 666, as well as the Under the Weather Sessions and The Friday Fuck Wit. In January 2007, former Lunch presenter, Myf Warhurst, joined McDougall and Whalley as a permanent member of the Breakfast Show team. Whalley left the show at the end of the year to travel overseas. The 2008-2009 Breakfast Show line up was Robbie Buck, McDougall and Marieke Hardy, and were known as Robbie, Marieke and the Doctor. The show continued The Friday Fuck Wit segment and included the radio serial, Claytron, produced by Australian comedian Sam Simmons. The show also contained the weekly Like a Version segment where recording artists perform a cover version of a song of their choice. In November 2009, Triple J announced that Tom Ballard and Alex Dyson, hosts of the 2009 Weekend Breakfast show, would take over as hosts of the 2010 Breakfast Show. The move was seen as a generational change catering to Triple J's 18- to 24-year-old core demographic. In December, McDougall was announced as the new host of the 3-5.30 pm afternoon Drive program for the following year. The move came after the 2008-2009 Drive presenter, Scott Dooley, signed with rival station, Nova 96.9. At the start of 2010, McDougall asked listeners to take pictures of their \"awesome stuff, precious things and treasured items\" to help decorate his new blog and Triple J website. In May listeners were asked to use their Twitter accounts to tweet food band puns, which could then be mentioned in the show. The topic trended globally at number 1 and number 2 on Twitter under the hashtags #bandfooodpuns and #foodbandpuns. In March Drive with The Doctor was broadcast from Alice Springs for Triple J's One Night Stand. In July and August it was broadcast from Woodford, Queensland for Splendour in the Grass, the program included live sets and interviews with bands from the festival line up. Guests on the 2010 program included Jack White, Lou Reed, Bret Easton Ellis, Chuck Palahniuk, MUSE, Phoenix, Arcade Fire, Damon Albarn, Mumford & Sons and Dizzee Rascal. Since 2010 The Doctor's show has been produced by his EP, Hannah Wickes. During his evening show on Triple J on Thursday 16 October 2014, McDougall announced that he will be leaving the show after 10 years of service to Triple J. He announced it with a song he recorded off air titled \"I'm F***ing Off\". He departed Triple J on 12 December 2014.
