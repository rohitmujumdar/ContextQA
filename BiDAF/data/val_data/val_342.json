{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Guns N' Roses' next album, G N' R Lies, was released in November 1988. It included the four recordings from the band's 1986 EP Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide, as well as four new acoustic tracks. \"Patience\", the only single released from G N' R Lies, peaked at No. 4 in the U.S., while the album itself reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200. The album cover, a parody of tabloid newspapers, was modified after initial pressings to remove the headlines \"Wife-beating has been around for 10,000 years\" and \"Ladies, welcome to the dark ages\". The song \"One in a Million\" raised accusations of racism and homophobia. Rose denied that he was a racist and defended his use of a racial slur, claiming that \"it's a word to describe somebody that is basically a pain in your life, a problem. The word nigger doesn't necessarily mean black,\" as well as listing the rap group N.W.A. and the John Lennon song Woman Is the Nigger of the World as other examples of musicians using the word. Several years later, Rose conceded that he had used the word as an insult towards black people who had tried to rob him, also using the word because it was taboo. In response to the allegations of homophobia, Rose stated that he considered himself \"pro-heterosexual\" and blamed this attitude on \"bad experiences\" with gay men. Guns N' Roses' late 1980s shows were often eventful for more than just the band's performance. During a November 1987 show in Atlanta, Rose assaulted a security guard and was held backstage by police, while his band mates continued playing with a roadie singing. Riots nearly broke out during two August 1988 shows in New York State. At England's Monsters of Rock festival, held that same month, two fans were crushed to death during the group's set by the slam-dancing crowd. During the first of four October 1989 dates opening for the Rolling Stones at the L.A. Coliseum, Rose announced that the shows would be the group's last if certain members of the band did not stop \"dancing with Mr. Brownstone,\" a reference to the band's song of the same name about heroin. Events such as these helped earn Guns N' Roses the moniker \"The Most Dangerous Band in the World.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "y", "question": "Was there any hits on lies?", "answers": [{"text": "Patience\", the only single released from G N' R Lies, peaked at No. 4 in the U.S.,", "answer_start": 191}, {"text": "\"Patience\", the only single released from G N' R Lies, peaked at No. 4 in the U.S.,", "answer_start": 190}, {"text": "It included the four recordings from the band's 1986 EP Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide, as well as four new acoustic tracks.", "answer_start": 71}, {"text": "Patience\", the only single released from G N' R Lies, peaked at No. 4 in the U.S.,", "answer_start": 191}, {"text": "the four recordings from the band's 1986 EP Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide, as well as four new acoustic tracks. \"", "answer_start": 83}], "id": "C_b5abd21a281e4ee38146567e0fb6800c_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "the four recordings from the band's 1986 EP Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide, as well as four new acoustic tracks. \"", "answer_start": 83}}, {"followup": "n", "yesno": "x", "question": "Did they tour for this album?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2161}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2161}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2161}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2161}], "id": "C_b5abd21a281e4ee38146567e0fb6800c_0_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2161}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "Did they win any awards for this album?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2161}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2161}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2161}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2161}], "id": "C_b5abd21a281e4ee38146567e0fb6800c_0_q#2", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2161}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "y", "question": "Was there any controversy mentioned?", "answers": [{"text": "The song \"One in a Million\" raised accusations of racism and homophobia.", "answer_start": 531}, {"text": "modified after initial pressings to remove the headlines \"Wife-beating has been around for 10,000 years\" and \"Ladies, welcome to the dark ages\".", "answer_start": 386}, {"text": "The song \"One in a Million\" raised accusations of racism and homophobia.", "answer_start": 531}, {"text": "The song \"One in a Million\" raised accusations of racism and homophobia.", "answer_start": 531}, {"text": "Riots nearly broke out during two August 1988 shows in New York State.
