{"paragraphs": [{"context": "On 6 December 2010, after the resignation of Martin Jol, De Boer was appointed caretaker manager of Ajax until the winter break. His first game in charge was a Champions League match against Milan at the San Siro, a match Ajax won 2-0 through goals from Demy de Zeeuw and Toby Alderweireld. De Boer then went on to help Ajax become champions of the Eredivisie for the 2010-11 season in a 3-1 home victory over Twente, the champions of the previous year, on the final matchday, making the first year of his professional coaching career a golden one. \"I couldn't have wished for a more beautiful birthday present,\" said De Boer, as the club's 30th championship was won on his 41st birthday. In two-and-a-half years at the helm of Ajax, De Boer won three championships, making eight in total (when including the five that he won as a player). According to reports, De Boer was offered the chance to interview for the Liverpool job but turned it down to remain with Ajax. \"I am honoured by the request [from Liverpool] but I have only just started with Ajax,\" he said. In 2013, De Boer received the Rinus Michels Award for manager of the year in the Netherlands after leading Ajax to their third successive Eredivisie title. On 27 April 2014, De Boer won his fourth successive Eredivisie title with Ajax, the first manager ever to achieve this in the Dutch league. Moreover, it marked the first time Ajax has ever won four successive Eredivisie titles. De Boer has now won a total of nine Eredivisie championships with Ajax as a player and manager, another record; Johan Cruyff, Sjaak Swart and Jack Reynolds all won eight Eredivisie championships with Ajax. Ajax finished the 2014-15 Eredivisie in second position, a massive 17 points behind champions PSV. On 11 May 2016, De Boer announced his resignation as manager of Ajax following a disappointing season when Ajax again lost out on the Eredivisie title to PSV on the final matchday of the season.
