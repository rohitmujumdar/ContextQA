{"paragraphs": [{"context": "The Marx Brothers' stage shows became popular just as motion pictures were evolving to \"talkies\". They signed a contract with Paramount Pictures and embarked on their film career at Paramount's studios in New York City's Astoria section. Their first two released films (after an unreleased short silent film titled Humor Risk) were adaptations of the Broadway shows The Cocoanuts (1929) and Animal Crackers (1930). Both were written by George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind. Production then shifted to Hollywood, beginning with a short film that was included in Paramount's twentieth anniversary documentary, The House That Shadows Built (1931), in which they adapted a scene from I'll Say She Is. Their third feature-length film, Monkey Business (1931), was their first movie not based on a stage production. Horse Feathers (1932), in which the brothers satirized the American college system and Prohibition, was their most popular film yet, and won them the cover of Time magazine. It included a running gag from their stage work, in which Harpo produces a ludicrous array of props from inside his coat, including a wooden mallet, a fish, a coiled rope, a tie, a poster of a woman in her underwear, a cup of hot coffee, a sword; and, just after Groucho warns him that he \"can't burn the candle at both ends,\" a candle burning at both ends. During this period Chico and Groucho starred in a radio comedy series, Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel. Though the series was short lived, much of the material developed for it was used in subsequent films. The show's scripts and recordings were believed lost until copies of the scripts were found in the Library of Congress in the 1980s. After publication in a book they were performed with Marx Brothers impersonators for BBC Radio. Their last Paramount film, Duck Soup (1933), directed by the highly regarded Leo McCarey, is the highest rated of the five Marx Brothers films on the American Film Institute's \"100 years ... 100 Movies\" list. It did not do as well financially as Horse Feathers, but was the sixth-highest grosser of 1933. The film sparked a dispute between the Marxes and the village of Fredonia, New York. \"Freedonia\" was the name of a fictional country in the script, and the city fathers wrote to Paramount and asked the studio to remove all references to Freedonia because \"it is hurting our town's image\". Groucho fired back a sarcastic retort asking them to change the name of their town, because \"it's hurting our picture.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What films did they make while at Paramount?", "answers": [{"text": "Their first two released films (after an unreleased short silent film titled Humor Risk) were adaptations of the Broadway shows The Cocoanuts (1929) and Animal Crackers (1930).", "answer_start": 238}, {"text": "short silent film titled Humor Risk) were adaptations of the Broadway shows The Cocoanuts (1929) and Animal Crackers (1930).", "answer_start": 290}, {"text": "were adaptations of the Broadway shows The Cocoanuts (1929) and Animal Crackers (1930", "answer_start": 327}, {"text": "Cocoanuts (1929) and Animal Crackers (1930).", "answer_start": 370}, {"text": "The Cocoanuts (1929) and Animal Crackers (1930).", "answer_start": 366}], "id": "C_0d2e27057e5b4a719138b3e9dd52f746_1_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "The Cocoanuts (1929) and Animal Crackers (1930).", "answer_start": 366}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "y", "question": "Did they have any additional projects?", "answers": [{"text": "Their third feature-length film, Monkey Business (1931), was their first movie not based on a stage production.", "answer_start": 697}, {"text": "The House That Shadows Built (1931), in which they adapted a scene from I'll Say She Is.", "answer_start": 608}, {"text": "The House That Shadows Built (1931),", "answer_start": 608}, {"text": "documentary, The House That Shadows Built (1931), in", "answer_start": 595}, {"text": "Their third feature-length film, Monkey Business (1931), was their first movie not based on a stage production.", "answer_start": 697}], "id": "C_0d2e27057e5b4a719138b3e9dd52f746_1_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "Their third feature-length film, Monkey Business (1931), was their first movie not based on a stage production.", "answer_start": 697}}, {"followup": "n", "yesno": "x", "question": "Was that a popular film?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2490}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2490}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2490}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2490}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2490}], "id": "C_0d2e27057e5b4a719138b3e9dd52f746_1_q#2", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2490}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "y", "question": "Is there any interesting information?", "answers": [{"text": "Their last Paramount film, Duck Soup (1933), directed by the highly regarded Leo McCarey, is the highest rated of the five Marx Brothers films", "answer_start": 1776}, {"text": "Horse Feathers (1932), in which the brothers satirized the American college system and Prohibition, was their most popular film yet,", "answer_start": 809}, {"text": "Horse Feathers (1932), in which the brothers satirized the American college system and Prohibition, was their most popular film yet,", "answer_start": 809}, {"text": "), in which the brothers satirized the American college", "answer_start": 829}, {"text": "Horse Feathers (1932), in which the brothers satirized the American college system and Prohibition, was their most popular film yet, and won them the cover of Time magazine.", "answer_start": 809}], "id": "C_0d2e27057e5b4a719138b3e9dd52f746_1_q#3", "orig_answer": {"text": "Horse Feathers (1932), in which the brothers satirized the American college system and Prohibition, was their most popular film yet, and won them the cover of Time magazine.", "answer_start": 809}}, {"followup": "n", "yesno": "x", "question": "Did they win any awards?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2490}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2490}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2490}], "id": "C_0d2e27057e5b4a719138b3e9dd52f746_1_q#4", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2490}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "Did they have any other films while at Paramount?", "answers": [{"text": "Paramount's twentieth anniversary documentary, The House That Shadows Built (1931), in which they adapted a scene from I'll Say She Is.", "answer_start": 561}, {"text": "film, Monkey Business (1931), was their first movie not based on a stage production.", "answer_start": 724}, {"text": "Duck Soup (1933),", "answer_start": 1803}, {"text": "film, Monkey Business (1931), was", "answer_start": 724}, {"text": "Their last Paramount film, Duck Soup (1933), directed by the highly regarded Leo McCarey,", "answer_start": 1776}], "id": "C_0d2e27057e5b4a719138b3e9dd52f746_1_q#5", "orig_answer": {"text": "Their last Paramount film, Duck Soup (1933), directed by the highly regarded Leo McCarey,", "answer_start": 1776}}], "id": "C_0d2e27057e5b4a719138b3e9dd52f746_1"}], "section_title": "Paramount", "background": "The Marx Brothers were an American family comedy act that was successful in vaudeville, on Broadway, and in motion pictures from 1905 to 1949.
