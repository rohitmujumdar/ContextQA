{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Over the years, the Kingston Trio expanded its song selection beyond the rearranged traditional numbers, calypso songs, and Broadway show tunes that had appeared on its first several albums. In an obituary for Nick Reynolds (d. October 1, 2008), Spencer Leigh wrote in Britain's Independent on Sunday: Looking at their repertoire now, it is apparent that the Kingston Trio was far more adventurous than is generally supposed. They introduced \"It Was A Very Good Year\" in 1961, later a standard for Frank Sinatra, and they were one of the first to spot the potential of English language versions of Jacques Brel's songs by recording \"Seasons in the Sun\" in 1963. They encouraged young songwriters including Hoyt Axton (\"Greenback Dollar\"), Rod McKuen (\"Ally Ally Oxen Free\", \"The World I Used to Know\") and Billy Edd Wheeler (\"Reverend Mr Black\"). Best of all, in 1962 they introduced listeners to one of the most poignant songs ever written, the anti-war ballad \"Where Have All The Flowers Gone?\" by Pete Seeger, formerly with the Weavers. Further, Peter Dreier points out that \"the group deserves credit for helping to launch the folk boom that brought recognition to older folkies and radicals like Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, and for paving the way for newcomers like Joan Baez, Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs, who were well known for their progressive political views and topical songs. By the time these younger folk singers arrived on the scene, the political climate had changed enough to provide a wide audience for protest music.\" The passage of time may well have made the controversy moot. Writing in the British daily The Guardian, again in an obituary for Reynolds, Ken Hunt asserted that \"[the Kingston Trio] helped to turn untold numbers of people on to folk music... [T]hey put the boom in folk boom. The Kingston Trio carried the torch overseas, most notably with their international hit of 1958, Tom Dooley. They were the greatest of the bands to emerge after the McCarthy-era blacklisting of folk musicians and breathed new air into the genre.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What is meant by the 21st-century perspectives?", "answers": [{"text": "Looking at their repertoire now, it is apparent that the Kingston Trio was far more adventurous than is generally supposed.", "answer_start": 302}, {"text": "By the time these younger folk singers arrived on the scene, the political climate had changed enough to provide a wide audience for protest music.\"", "answer_start": 1387}, {"text": "Looking at their repertoire now, it is apparent that the Kingston Trio was far more adventurous than is generally supposed.", "answer_start": 302}, {"text": "the Kingston Trio expanded its song selection beyond the rearranged traditional numbers, calypso songs, and Broadway show tunes", "answer_start": 16}, {"text": "expanded its song selection beyond the rearranged traditional numbers, calypso songs, and Broadway show tunes that had appeared on its first several albums.", "answer_start": 34}], "id": "C_40c7c5d44ee4405fb6facdb95f47b192_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "expanded its song selection beyond the rearranged traditional numbers, calypso songs, and Broadway show tunes that had appeared on its first several albums.", "answer_start": 34}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What are some other important things to happen during this time?", "answers": [{"text": "\"the group deserves credit for helping to launch the folk boom that brought recognition to older folkies and radicals like Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger,", "answer_start": 1078}, {"text": "They were the greatest of the bands to emerge after the McCarthy-era blacklisting of folk musicians and breathed new air into the genre.\"", "answer_start": 1922}, {"text": "They introduced \"It Was A Very Good Year\" in 1961, later a standard for Frank Sinatra,", "answer_start": 426}, {"text": "They introduced \"It Was A Very Good Year\" in 1961, later a standard for Frank Sinatra,", "answer_start": 426}, {"text": "They introduced \"It Was A Very Good Year\" in 1961, later a standard for Frank Sinatra,", "answer_start": 426}], "id": "C_40c7c5d44ee4405fb6facdb95f47b192_0_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "They introduced \"It Was A Very Good Year\" in 1961, later a standard for Frank Sinatra,", "answer_start": 426}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "How did it turn out after it was introduced?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2060}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2060}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2060}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2060}], "id": "C_40c7c5d44ee4405fb6facdb95f47b192_0_q#2", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2060}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "y", "question": "Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?", "answers": [{"text": "By the time these younger folk singers arrived on the scene, the political climate had changed enough to provide a wide audience for protest music.", "answer_start": 1387}, {"text": "in 1962 they introduced listeners to one of the most poignant songs ever written, the anti-war ballad \"Where Have All The Flowers Gone?\"", "answer_start": 860}, {"text": "they were one of the first to spot the potential of English language versions of Jacques Brel's songs by recording \"Seasons in the Sun\" in 1963.", "answer_start": 517}, {"text": "Peter Dreier points out that \"the group deserves credit for helping to launch the folk boom that brought recognition to older folkies and radicals", "answer_start": 1049}, {"text": "\"the group deserves credit for helping to launch the folk boom that brought recognition to older folkies and radicals like Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger,", "answer_start": 1078}], "id": "C_40c7c5d44ee4405fb6facdb95f47b192_0_q#3", "orig_answer": {"text": "\"the group deserves credit for helping to launch the folk boom that brought recognition to older folkies and radicals like Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger,", "answer_start": 1078}}, {"followup": "n", "yesno": "x", "question": "Did they eventually get the credit that they deserve?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2060}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2060}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2060}], "id": "C_40c7c5d44ee4405fb6facdb95f47b192_0_q#4", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2060}}], "id": "C_40c7c5d44ee4405fb6facdb95f47b192_0"}], "section_title": "21st-century perspectives", "background": "The Kingston Trio is an American folk and pop music group that helped launch the folk revival of the late 1950s to late 1960s.
