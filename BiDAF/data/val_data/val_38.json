{"paragraphs": [{"context": "After Richard M. Kleberg won a 1931 special election to represent Texas in the United States House of Representatives, he appointed Johnson as his legislative secretary. Johnson got the position on the recommendation of his own father and that of State Senator Welly Hopkins, who Johnson had campaigned for in 1930. Kleberg had little interest in performing the day-to-day duties of a Congressman, instead delegating them to Johnson. After Franklin D. Roosevelt won the 1932 presidential election, Johnson became a staunch supporter of Roosevelt's New Deal. Johnson was elected speaker of the \"Little Congress,\" a group of Congressional aides, where he cultivated Congressmen, newspapermen, and lobbyists. Johnson's friends soon included aides to President Roosevelt as well as fellow Texans such as Vice President John Nance Garner and Congressman Sam Rayburn. Johnson married Claudia Alta Taylor, also known as \"Lady Bird\", of Karnack, Texas on November 17, 1934, after he attended Georgetown University Law Center for several months. The wedding was officiated by Rev. Arthur R. McKinstry at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in San Antonio. They had two daughters, Lynda Bird, born in 1944, and Luci Baines, born in 1947. Johnson gave his children names with the LBJ initials; his dog was Little Beagle Johnson. His was the LBJ Ranch; his initials were on his cufflinks, ashtrays, and clothes. In 1935, he was appointed head of the Texas National Youth Administration, which enabled him to use the government to create education and job opportunities for young people. He resigned two years later to run for Congress. Johnson, a notoriously tough boss throughout his career, often demanded long workdays and work on weekends. He was described by friends, fellow politicians, and historians as motivated by an exceptional lust for power and control. As Johnson's biographer Robert Caro observes, \"Johnson's ambition was uncommon--in the degree to which it was unencumbered by even the slightest excess weight of ideology, of philosophy, of principles, of beliefs.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "n", "yesno": "x", "question": "was Johnson elected in anything in 11th grade?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}], "id": "C_46bc6788221746e59d0a8c13d773ce58_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "what was the name of the church his father and grandfather joined?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}], "id": "C_46bc6788221746e59d0a8c13d773ce58_0_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}}, {"followup": "n", "yesno": "x", "question": "who was johnsons grandfather?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}], "id": "C_46bc6788221746e59d0a8c13d773ce58_0_q#2", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}}, {"followup": "m", "yesno": "x", "question": "who was he maternally a descendant of?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}], "id": "C_46bc6788221746e59d0a8c13d773ce58_0_q#3", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2062}}], "id": "C_46bc6788221746e59d0a8c13d773ce58_0"}], "section_title": "Entry into politics", "background": "Lyndon Baines Johnson (; August 27, 1908 - January 22, 1973), often referred to by his initials LBJ, was an American politician who served as the 36th President of the United States from 1963 to 1969, assuming the office after having served as the 37th Vice President of the United States from 1961 to 1963.
