{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Craddock's first release was \"Smacky-Mouth\", which was recorded in 1957 for the local Greensboro Sky Castle label. He released his next single, titled \"Birddoggin'\", on Colonial Records. It was also released in 1957. He soon got a deal with Columbia's Date Records. He released \"Ah, Poor Little Baby\" with no success. The song was covered in England by Adam Faith. He began recording for Columbia Records in 1958, recording rockabilly and pop tunes. He was marketed as a teen idol by Columbia, as they needed an artist to compete with Elvis. He appeared twice on American Bandstand but failed to have a hit in the U.S. The only song that charted in the U.S. was Don't Destroy Me, which peaked at No. 94 for one week in November 1959. He did, however, become very popular in Australia. He also recorded some songs that become synonymous with other artistes. He recorded \"Am I to Be the One\" and \"I Want That\", which were covered most notably by Jerry Lee Lewis and UK rockers Johnny Kidd and the Pirates. In 1959, Craddock traveled to Australia with Bobby Rydell, The Everly Brothers, Santo and Johnny, and The Diamonds. He didn't know how popular he was in the country and didn't think that anyone would recognize him there. When the plane arrived at the airport, there were thousands of screaming teenagers. Craddock didn't know that he had the number one record in the country. He soon became the most popular teen idol in the country and is still popular today. After his hits in Australia, he recorded one album and several singles during the 1960s. \"I'm Tore Up\" was released in 1964 on King Records. He released two singles with Mercury Records in the early 1960s. He then went on to record several singles with the Chart label with no success.
