{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In the 1990s, the band split up after a disagreement about royalties. Hadley, Norman and Keeble launched an unsuccessful court case against Gary Kemp for a share of Kemp's songwriting royalties from his work with Spandau Ballet. Although they vowed to appeal the verdict, they later decided against this. The three non-Kemp members then continued to tour as a trio, but they had to sell their shares in Spandau Ballet's company to Gary Kemp to pay off legal debts. Because the company owned the rights to the name of Spandau Ballet, the trio had to tour under the moniker \"Hadley, Norman and Keeble, ex-Spandau Ballet\". In 1990, the Kemp brothers played the lead roles in the film The Krays. Martin Kemp landed an acting role in the UK soap opera EastEnders. Gary Kemp also did more acting, appearing in a supporting role in the Whitney Houston hit The Bodyguard. In 1995 he released his only solo album, Little Bruises. Meanwhile, Tony Hadley tried to establish a solo career but with little success. After leaving EastEnders, Martin Kemp continued acting in various high-profile projects and appeared on TV in other roles. He wrote and directed his first film, Martin Kemp's Stalker. Gary Kemp wrote songs with Paul Stratham, who had written songs for Dido, continued acting on stage, in film and in television, and worked on the musicals Begbug and A Terrible Beauty with Guy Pratt. Steve Norman moved to Ibiza, where he formed a lounge band, Cloudfish, with Rafa Peletey and Shelley Preston in 2001. Hadley released three studio albums, landed the lead role in the musical Chicago and won the ITV reality show Reborn in the USA. In 1999, Hadley appeared as a guest vocalist on the Alan Parsons album The Time Machine, performing lead vocals on the song \"Out of the Blue\".
