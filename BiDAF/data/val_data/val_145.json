{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Criticism has been leveled against Finkelstein from several angles. The first sources are responses from those whose work Finkelstein has discussed. Daniel Goldhagen, whose book Hitler's Willing Executioners Finkelstein criticized, claimed his scholarship has \"everything to do with his burning political agenda\". Alan Dershowitz has written that Peter Novick, Professor of History at the University of Chicago and a noted Holocaust historian whose work Finkelstein says inspired The Holocaust Industry, has strongly criticized the latter's work, describing it as \"trash\". Similarly, Dershowitz, whose book The Case for Israel and Finkelstein's response Beyond Chutzpah sparked an ongoing feud between the two, has claimed Finkelstein's complicity in a conspiracy against pro-Israel scholars: \"The mode of attack is consistent. Chomsky selects the target and directs Finkelstein to probe the writings in minute detail and conclude that the writer didn't actually write the work, that it is plagiarized, that it is a hoax and a fraud,\" arguing that Finkelstein has leveled charges against many academics, calling at least 10 \"distinguished Jews 'hucksters', 'hoaxters' (sic), 'thieves', 'extortionists', and worse.\" Although the back and forth between Finkelstein and Dershowitz received the most attention and attracted significant controversy, Finkelstein has maintained that \"the real issue is Israel's human rights record.\" Israeli historian Omer Bartov, writing for The New York Times Book Review, judged The Holocaust Industry to be marred by the same errors he denounces in those who exploit the Holocaust for profit or politics: It is filled with precisely the kind of shrill hyperbole that Finkelstein rightly deplores in much of the current media hype over the Holocaust; it is brimming with the same indifference to historical facts, inner contradictions, strident politics and dubious contextualizations; and it oozes with the same smug sense of moral and intellectual superiority... Like any conspiracy theory, it contains several grains of truth; and like any such theory, it is both irrational and insidious. Finkelstein has accused journalist Jeffrey Goldberg of \"torturing\" or \"being an accessory to torture of\" Palestinian prisoners during his IDF service in the First Intifada, based on statements made in Goldberg's book Prisoners. Finkelstein says that Goldberg admits to personally sending prisoners to the zinzana, which he says has been repeatedly condemned as torture in human rights reports. Goldberg referred to the allegation as \"ridiculous\" and he had \"never laid a hand on anybody.\" Goldberg said his \"principal role\" was \"making sure prisoners had fresh fruit.\" He characterized Finkelstein as a \"ridiculous figure\" and accused him of \"lying and purposely misreading my book.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What were Norman's
