{"paragraphs": [{"context": "After the resignation of Argentina national team coach Alfio Basile in 2008, Maradona immediately proposed his candidacy for the vacant role. According to several press sources, his major challengers included Diego Simeone, Carlos Bianchi, Miguel Angel Russo and Sergio Batista. On 29 October 2008, AFA chairman Julio Grondona confirmed that Maradona would be the head coach of the national team from December 2008. On 19 November 2008, Maradona managed Argentina for the first time when Argentina played against Scotland at Hampden Park in Glasgow, which Argentina won 1-0. After winning his first three matches in charge of the national team, he oversaw a 6-1 defeat to Bolivia, equalling the team's worst ever margin of defeat. With two matches remaining in the qualification tournament for the 2010 World Cup, Argentina was in fifth place and faced the possibility of failing to qualify, but victory in the last two matches secured qualification for the finals. After Argentina's qualification, Maradona used abusive language at the live post-game press conference, telling members of the media to \"suck it and keep on sucking it\". FIFA responded with a two-month ban on all footballing activity, which expired on 15 January 2010, and a CHF 25,000 fine, with a warning as to his future conduct. The friendly match scheduled to take place at home to the Czech Republic on 15 December, during the period of the ban, was cancelled. The only match Argentina played during Maradona's ban was a friendly away to Catalonia, which they lost 4-2. At the World Cup finals in June 2010, Argentina started by winning 1-0 against Nigeria, followed by a 4-1 victory over South Korea on the strength of a Gonzalo Higuain hat-trick. In the final match of the group stage, Argentina won 2-0 against Greece to win the group and advance to a second round, meeting Mexico. After defeating Mexico 3-1, however, Argentina was routed by Germany 4-0 in the quarter-finals to go out of the competition. Argentina was ranked fifth in the tournament. After the defeat to Germany, Maradona admitted that he was considering his future as Argentina coach, stating, \"I may leave tomorrow.\" On 15 July 2010, the AFA said that he would be offered a new four-year deal that would keep him in charge through to the summer of 2014 when Brazil stages the World Cup. On 27 July, however, the AFA announced that its board had unanimously decided not to renew his contract. Afterwards, on 29 July, Maradona claimed that AFA president Julio Grondona and director of national teams (as well as his former Argentine national team and Sevilla coach) Carlos Bilardo had \"lied to\", \"betrayed\" and effectively sacked him from the role. He said, \"They wanted me to continue, but seven of my staff should not go on, if he told me that, it meant he did not want me to keep working.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "Who did Maradona manage?", "answers": [{"text": "After the resignation of Argentina national team coach Alfio Basile in 2008, Maradona immediately proposed his candidacy for the vacant role.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "After the resignation of Argentina national team coach Alfio Basile in 2008, Maradona immediately proposed his candidacy for the vacant role.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "the national team", "answer_start": 378}, {"text": "Maradona managed Argentina", "answer_start": 437}, {"text": "After the resignation of Argentina national team coach Alfio Basile in 2008, Maradona immediately proposed his candidacy for the vacant role.", "answer_start": 0}], "id": "C_402a1f3800d940649b0aa2b8219f3442_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "After the resignation of Argentina national team coach Alfio Basile in 2008, Maradona immediately proposed his candidacy for the vacant role.", "answer_start": 0}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "How long was Maradona the team coach for Argentina?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2837}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2837}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2837}], "id": "C_402a1f3800d940649b0aa2b8219f3442_0_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2837}}, {"followup": "n", "yesno": "x", "question": "How many wins did Maradona have with Argentina?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2837}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2837}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2837}], "id": "C_402a1f3800d940649b0aa2b8219f3442_0_q#2", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2837}}, {"followup": "n", "yesno": "x", "question": "How many years was Maradona a team manager?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2837}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2837}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2837}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2837}], "id": "C_402a1f3800d940649b0aa2b8219f3442_0_q#3", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2837}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What years was Maradona a team manager?", "answers": [{"text": "On 15 July 2010, the AFA said that he would be offered a new four-year deal that would keep him in charge through to the summer of 2014", "answer_start": 2163}, {"text": "On 19 November 2008, Maradona managed Argentina for the first time", "answer_start": 416}, {"text": "On 19 November 2008, Maradona managed Argentina for the first time when Argentina played against Scotland at Hampden Park in Glasgow,", "answer_start": 416}, {"text": "the AFA said that he would be offered a new four-year deal that would keep him in charge through to the summer of 2014 when Brazil stages the World Cup.", "answer_start": 2180}], "id": "C_402a1f3800d940649b0aa2b8219f3442_0_q#4", "orig_answer": {"text": "the AFA said that he would be offered a new four-year deal that would keep him in charge through to the summer of 2014 when Brazil stages the World Cup.", "answer_start": 2180}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "n", "question": "Was his contract renewed?", "answers": [{"text": "July, however, the AFA announced that its board had unanimously decided not to renew his contract.", "answer_start": 2339}, {"text": "On 27 July, however, the AFA announced that its board had unanimously decided not to renew his contract.", "answer_start": 2333}, {"text": "the AFA announced that its board had unanimously decided not to renew his contract.", "answer_start": 2354}, {"text": "On 27 July, however, the AFA announced that its board had unanimously decided not to renew his contract.", "answer_start": 2333}, {"text": "Carlos Bilardo had \"lied to\", \"betrayed\" and effectively sacked him from the role.
