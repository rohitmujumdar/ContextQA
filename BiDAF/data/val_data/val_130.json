{"paragraphs": [{"context": "After the departure of Race and Lane, the remaining members relocated to West Berlin, Germany, in 1985 and released a second album The Firstborn Is Dead. The album was heavily influenced by the gothic Americana of the American South and blues music, exemplified in songs such as \"Tupelo\" and \"Blind Lemon Jefferson\", which reference the birth of Elvis Presley and Blind Lemon Jefferson respectively. Released the following year, the cover version album Kicking Against the Pricks explored such influences more directly with renditions of material by Johnny Cash, John Lee Hooker and Lead Belly. The 1986 album also marked the arrival of Swiss drummer Thomas Wydler, a member of Die Haut, and featured guest appearances from Race, Pew, and Birthday Party guitarist Howard, who had briefly toured with the Bad Seeds as a substitute member in 1985. Pew's death from an epileptic seizure also occurred in 1986. The band garnered an increased following due to a second 1986 album release, Your Funeral, My Trial, which coincided with Adamson's departure. Tender Prey, the dark, brooding 1988 follow-up, saw the arrival of American guitarist Kid Congo Powers--Harvey made the transition to bass--and short-tenured German keyboardist Roland Wolf. The single \"The Mercy Seat\" chronicled an unrepentant prisoner on death row and further increased the group's critical acclaim and commercial attention. The track later received the honor being covered by Cash on his 2000 album American III: Solitary Man. Despite the increasing level of success, the drug-related issues of band members became problematic. The documentary film The Road to God Knows Where, directed by Uli M Schueppel, depicts a five-week period of the United States leg of their 1989 tour. Cave and his bandmates also pursued other creative ambitions around this time. In 1987, the Bad Seeds appeared in the Wim Wenders film Wings of Desire, and Cave was also featured in the 1988 film Ghosts... of the Civil Dead, which he and Race co-wrote. Cave's first novel And the Ass Saw the Angel was published in 1989.
