{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Slick has been married twice--to Gerald \"Jerry\" Slick, a cinematographer, from 1961 to 1971, then to Skip Johnson, a Jefferson Starship lighting designer, from 1976 to 1994. She has one child--a daughter, China Wing Kantner (born January 25, 1971). China's father is the former Jefferson Airplane guitarist Paul Kantner, with whom Slick had a relationship from 1969 to 1975. During her hospital stay after China's birth, Slick joked to one of the attending nurses that she intended to name the child \"god\" with a lowercase g, as she \"wished for the child to be humble.\" The nurse took Slick seriously, and her report of the incident caused a minor stir, as well as the creation of a rock-and-roll urban legend. Slick publicly has acknowledged her alcoholism, discussed her rehabilitation experiences, and commented on her use of LSD, marijuana, and other substances in her autobiography, various interviews, and several celebrity addiction and recovery books, including The Courage to Change by Dennis Wholey and The Harder They Fall by Gary Stromberg and Jane Merrill. During Jefferson Starship's 1978 European tour, Slick's alcoholism became a problem for the band. The group had to cancel the first night in Germany because she was too intoxicated to perform, causing the audience to riot. Slick performed the next night with the band, but was so inebriated she could not sing properly. She also attacked the audience, mocking Germany for losing World War II, and groping both female audience members and bandmates. The next day, she left the group. That same year, Slick was dragged off a San Francisco game show for abusing the contestants. She was admitted to a detoxification facility at least twice, once during the 1970s at Duffy's in Napa Valley, and once in the 1990s with daughter China.
