{"paragraphs": [{"context": "The band took an extended break after their second album, in an effort to evolve their sound. New material was written, and recording sessions took place in New York during 2006. Failing to meet the band's standards, many of these new songs were ultimately discarded, and remain unreleased. \"We were definitely striving for a new standard,\" Deasy said in 2007. \"We were willing to scrap months of work on songs, which is one of the reasons it took so long. We recorded maybe 30 songs.\" During an interview with indie music magazine Under The Radar in October 2007, Deasy stated: \"We wrote about 30 songs for this album, and a lot of the songs we discarded. They weren't poor songs. They were perfectly good songs, but they were songs that could have fit on the first or the second album a little too easily.\" More new material was written, including \"Midnight Choir\" which became the opening track for Teenager and was also released as a single. At the suggestion of R.E.M., the five relocated to a renovated morgue (owned by Canadian musician Bryan Adams) in inner-city Vancouver to record their third album with Tony Hoffer, who had previously produced their debut album. Teenager was released in Ireland on 22 July 2007 and Central Europe on 25 July 2007. It failed to light up the British and Irish charts, but received mixed reviews, getting a Metacritic score of 71%, positive reviews from the BBC, 7/10 from the NME, a 6.9/10 from Pitchfork and a 2/5 review from The Guardian. A special CD/DVD edition of Teenager - which contained a film-length documentary about the band entitled The Thrills: The End of Innocence - was given limited release in the UK only.
