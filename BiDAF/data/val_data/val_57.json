{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In addition to changes in the tone of the show, Noah has also implemented stylistic changes to the show, with an updated set, new graphics and his monologue sometimes taking place while standing in front of a screen as opposed to sitting at the desk. Trevor also increased the usage of more millennial-based references, impersonations and characterizations for his comedy on the show, due to his younger demographic and his ability to speak in multiple accents and eight languages. The debut of The Daily Show with Trevor Noah brought along three new correspondents: Roy Wood Jr., Desi Lydic and Ronny Chieng. Additional correspondents were added in 2017. Michael Kosta became the Senior Constitutional Correspondent and Senior American Correspondent in July 11, 2017. Dulce Sloan became the Senior Fashion Correspondent in September 7, 2017. In January 2016, The Daily Show with Trevor Noah started to use a modified version of the show's previous theme, composed by Timbaland and King Logan. The theme is a remix of the old theme with the addition of rock. Trevor Noah also avoided talking too much about Fox News, as Stewart was previously known for. \"The Daily Show was based on an emerging 24 hour news cycle, that's everything it was, that's what inspired The Daily Show. Now you look at news and it's changed. It's no longer predicated around 24 hour news. There are so many different choices. Half of it is online now. Now you've got the 'Gawker's, the 'Buzzfeed's. The way people are drawing their news is soundbites and headlines and click-bait links has changed everything. The biggest challenge is going to be an exciting one I'm sure is how are we going to bring all of that together looking at it from a bigger lens as opposed to just going after one source -- which was historically Fox News\" Noah said at a press conference before the show's debut.
