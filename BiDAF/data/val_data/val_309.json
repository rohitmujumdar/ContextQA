{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Status Quo was formed in 1962 under the name \"The Scorpions\" by Francis Rossi and Alan Lancaster at Sedgehill Comprehensive School, Catford, along with classmates Jess Jaworski (keyboards) and Alan Key (drums). Rossi and Lancaster played their first gig at the Samuel Jones Sports Club in Dulwich, London. In 1963, Key was replaced by John Coghlan and the band changed name to \"The Spectres\". In 1965, when Rossi, Lancaster, and Jaworski had reached the end of their school education, Jaworski opted to leave the band, and was replaced by Roy Lynes. They began writing their own material and later that year met Rick Parfitt who was playing with a cabaret band called The Highlights. By the end of 1965, Rossi and Parfitt, who had become close friends, made a commitment to continue working together. On 18 July 1966, The Spectres signed a five-year deal with Piccadilly Records, releasing two singles that year, \"I (Who Have Nothing)\" and \"Hurdy Gurdy Man\" (written by Alan Lancaster), and one the next year called \"(We Ain't Got) Nothin' Yet\" (a song originally recorded by New York psychedelic band The Blues Magoos). All three singles failed to make an impact on the charts. By 1967, the group had discovered psychedelia and named themselves Traffic, but were soon forced to change it to \"Traffic Jam\" to avoid confusion with Steve Winwood's Traffic, following an argument over who had registered the name first. The band secured an appearance on BBC Radio's Saturday Club, but in June their next single, \"Almost But Not Quite There\", underperformed. The following month saw Parfitt, at the request of manager Pat Barlow, joining the band as rhythm guitarist and vocalist. Shortly after Parfitt's recruitment, in August 1967, the band officially became The Status Quo.
