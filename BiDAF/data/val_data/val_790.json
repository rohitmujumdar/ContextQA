{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Morgan was born in Nashville, Tennessee, and made her first appearance on the Grand Ole Opry at age 13, performing Fred Spielman and Janice Torre's \"Paper Roses\". After her father died in 1975, she took over his band at age 16 and began leading the group through various club gigs. After disbanding the group, she joined the Little Roy Wiggins band in 1977. She then became a receptionist and demo singer at Acuff-Rose Music, where she also wrote songs. In the late 1970s, she was the featured vocalist on a morning television show hosted by Ralph Emery, on Nashville's WSM-TV (now WSMV); Emery was a longtime friend of her father, who appeared on Emery's Opry Star Spotlight, an overnight music and interview show that ran for many years on WSM-AM. Morgan had one minor hit single in 1978; the following year she recorded another minor hit with \"I'm Completely Satisfied With You,\" an electronically dubbed duet with her father who died in 1975. She began touring Nashville nightclubs and opened for a number of acts, including Jack Greene, Billy Thunderkloud and Jeannie Seely. She toured as a duet partner with George Jones and spent two years as part of the Opryland USA bluegrass show and as a regular singer on TNN's Nashville Now. In 1984, Morgan scored a minor hit with \"Don't Go Changing.\" That year she became the youngest singer ever to join the Grand Ole Opry. Four years later, she signed with RCA Records, her first major label; her first album on that label, Leave the Light On, was released in 1989.
