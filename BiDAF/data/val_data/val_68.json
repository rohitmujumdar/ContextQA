{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Eighty-four ethics charges were filed by Democrats against Gingrich during his term as Speaker. All were eventually dropped except for one: claiming tax-exempt status for a college course run for political purposes. On January 21, 1997, the House officially reprimanded Gingrich (in a vote of 395 in favor, 28 opposed) and \"ordered [him] to reimburse the House for some of the costs of the investigation in the amount of $300,000\". It was the first time a Speaker was disciplined for an ethics violation. Additionally, the House Ethics Committee concluded that inaccurate information supplied to investigators represented \"intentional or ... reckless\" disregard of House rules. The Ethics Committee's Special Counsel James M. Cole concluded that Gingrich had violated federal tax law and had lied to the ethics panel in an effort to force the committee to dismiss the complaint against him. The full committee panel did not agree whether tax law had been violated and left that issue up to the IRS. In 1999, the IRS cleared the organizations connected with the \"Renewing American Civilization\" courses under investigation for possible tax violations. Regarding the situation, Gingrich said in January 1997, \"I did not manage the effort intensely enough to thoroughly direct or review information being submitted to the committee on my behalf. In my name and over my signature, inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable statements were given to the committee, but I did not intend to mislead the committee ... I brought down on the people's house a controversy which could weaken the faith people have in their government.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "n", "yesno": "x", "question": "How did Gingrich role help in the government?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1619}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1619}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1619}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1619}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1619}], "id": "C_8141f2ac97ad45569ddd35b42821fea3_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1619}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "y", "question": "where there any conflicts in Gingrich career?", "answers": [{"text": "Eighty-four ethics charges were filed by Democrats against Gingrich during his term as Speaker.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Eighty-four ethics charges were filed by Democrats against Gingrich during his term as Speaker.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Additionally, the House Ethics Committee concluded that inaccurate information supplied to investigators represented \"intentional or ... reckless\" disregard of House rules.", "answer_start": 505}, {"text": "Eighty-four ethics charges were filed by Democrats against Gingrich during his term as Speaker.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Eighty-four ethics charges were filed by Democrats against Gingrich", "answer_start": 0}], "id": "C_8141f2ac97ad45569ddd35b42821fea3_0_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "Eighty-four ethics charges were filed by Democrats against Gingrich", "answer_start": 0}}, {"followup": "n", "yesno": "x", "question": "did Gingrich have any influences?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1619}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1619}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1619}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1619}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1619}], "id": "C_8141f2ac97ad45569ddd35b42821fea3_0_q#2", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1619}}, {"followup": "n", "yesno": "x", "question": "How did Gingrich role help pass the federal budget?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1619}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1619}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1619}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1619}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1619}], "id": "C_8141f2ac97ad45569ddd35b42821fea3_0_q#3", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1619}}], "id": "C_8141f2ac97ad45569ddd35b42821fea3_0"}], "section_title": "Ethics charges and reprimand", "background": "Newton Leroy Gingrich (; ne McPherson; born June 17, 1943) is an American politician and author from the state of Pennsylvania who served as the 50th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1995 to 1999.
