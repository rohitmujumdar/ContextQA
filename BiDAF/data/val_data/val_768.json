{"paragraphs": [{"context": "At the end of 2006, Yung released the Cantonese album Close Up to commercial success, selling out at stores over Hong Kong as well as online CD stores. A second version of the album was released on 26 January 2007, containing a bonus DVD with music videos for the songs \"Splendid Encounter (Hua Li Xie Hou )\" and \"Elated Heart (Xin Hua Nu Fang )\". Around the same time, Yung held a concert organised by Neway with appearances from other artists such as Anthony Wong, at17, Hins Cheung, Yumiko Cheng, Vincent Wong, and Sun Boy'z. In 2007, she became Hong Kong's ambassador of the World Vision 30 Hour Famine campaign and visited Kenya in March. On 5 July, she released her fifth Mandarin album, Insignificant Me, with the title track produced by Jay Chou. Unfortunately, it was one of her worst selling Mandarin album. On 7 July, she performed at the Live Earth concert in Shanghai. On 7 November, she released another album, Glow. In early 2008, Yung released her fourth compilation album Love Joey 4, and held her fifth concert titled StarLight Live over ten days at the Hong Kong Coliseum. During the concert she performed \"The Power Medley\", a 20-minute intense dance medley of her fast-tempo tracks. The concert's success led to a four-night extension. In February, Yung travelled to New York City with the hope of improving her dancing skills. That year she sang a number of official songs for the 2008 Beijing Olympics and began a world tour shortly afterwards with shows in Malaysia, Canada, the United States, Mainland China, Singapore, and Macau. The year 2009 marked the tenth anniversary of Yung's career with EEG. To celebrate the occasion, two albums (A Time For Us and Very Busy) and a documentary were released and a mini-concert (Perfect Ten Live at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre's Grand Theatre, where Yung won her first major singing contest in 1995) was held on 4 October, with tickets for the two shows selling out within seven minutes. The \"Perfect Ten Live Boxset\" was released in two versions in December: the normal version included two concert DVDs, the Perfect 10 documentary, and a photo album; while deluxe version contained two more CDs from Perfect Ten Live and more photos. Towards the end of the year, Yung performed at the concert Music Is Live with Mobile Chan, and won the Media Award for the third time (having previously won the award in 2003 and 2004).
