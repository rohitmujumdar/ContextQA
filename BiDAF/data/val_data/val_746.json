{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In the summer of 1992, White filled in guitar duties at the last minute for Bay Area punk band Monsula, who were performing at Little Rock, AR club Vino's. After the performance, Jason toured as guitarist for the band and eventually relocated to the Bay Area after the breakup of Chino Horde in summer 1993. White joined the Big Cats in 1996, after the temporary departure of bassist Josh Bentley, and took over guitar duties in 2000 after the death of guitarist Shannon Yarbrough. The group is a side project of many musicians, playing live very rarely. Their newest record, On Tomorrow, was released in 2007. Because of Pinhead Gunpowder's infamy for sporadic get-togethers, White and Gunpowder bassist Bill Schneider began looking to form another band that would be a group the two could focus on. After recruiting Schneider's brother Greg Schneider to join and finally convincing Willie Samuels to play drums, The Influents were formed. White and Greg would become the focus of the band, splitting songwriting duties, as well as singing time. Bill Schneider left the band on good terms after the group's first album Check Please to focus on his drum shop and was soon replaced by Johnnie Wentz. The new line-up soon recorded a follow up, Some of the Young, and went on tour. In 2006, Jason recorded a cover of The Replacements \"Torture\" for the Replacements Cover compilation, \"We'll Inherit the Earth\". He's also featured in the May 2007 release, Towncraft, a documentary covering twenty years of the punk music scene in Little Rock, AR, White's home. That same year, White played with Green Day in the video for the cover of \"Working Class Hero.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What happened in 1992", "answers": [{"text": "In the summer of 1992, White filled in guitar duties at the last minute for Bay Area punk band Monsula, who were performing at Little Rock, AR club Vino's.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "In the summer of 1992, White filled in guitar duties at the last minute for Bay Area punk band Monsula, who were performing at Little Rock, AR club Vino's.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "White filled in guitar duties at the last minute for Bay Area punk band Monsula, who were performing at Little Rock, AR club Vino's.", "answer_start": 23}, {"text": "White filled in guitar duties at the last minute for Bay Area punk band Monsula,", "answer_start": 23}, {"text": "In the summer of 1992, White filled in guitar duties at the last minute for Bay Area punk band Monsula, who were performing at Little Rock, AR club Vino's.", "answer_start": 0}], "id": "C_25aefa033eb6467eaa1387cbee0e692b_1_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "In the summer of 1992, White filled in guitar duties at the last minute for Bay Area punk band Monsula, who were performing at Little Rock, AR club Vino's.", "answer_start": 0}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What happened after that", "answers": [{"text": "Jason toured as guitarist for the band and eventually relocated to the Bay Area after the breakup of Chino Horde in summer 1993.", "answer_start": 179}, {"text": "Jason toured as guitarist for the band and eventually relocated to the Bay Area after the breakup of Chino Horde in summer 1993.", "answer_start": 179}, {"text": "After the performance, Jason toured as guitarist for the band and eventually relocated to the Bay Area after the breakup of Chino Horde in summer 1993.", "answer_start": 156}, {"text": "Jason toured as guitarist for the band and eventually relocated to the Bay Area after the breakup of Chino Horde in summer 1993.", "answer_start": 179}, {"text": "After the performance, Jason toured as guitarist for the band and eventually relocated to the Bay Area after the breakup of Chino Horde in summer 1993.", "answer_start": 156}], "id": "C_25aefa033eb6467eaa1387cbee0e692b_1_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "After the performance, Jason toured as guitarist for the band and eventually relocated to the Bay Area after the breakup of Chino Horde in summer 1993.", "answer_start": 156}}, {"followup": "m", "yesno": "x", "question": "What was the breakup of chino horde?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1653}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1653}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1653}], "id": "C_25aefa033eb6467eaa1387cbee0e692b_1_q#2", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1653}}, {"followup": "n", "yesno": "x", "question": "What happened in 1994", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1653}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1653}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1653}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1653}], "id": "C_25aefa033eb6467eaa1387cbee0e692b_1_q#3", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1653}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "y", "question": "any other interesting facts?", "answers": [{"text": "on.
