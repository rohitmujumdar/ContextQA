{"paragraphs": [{"context": "By the beginning of 2004 the band announced their first Greatest Hits compilation was going to be released, a cover of Nick Kamen's \"I Promised Myself\" became the last single from the band. The band shot the video for the song in March 2004, and was premiered on ZTV in early April, the song went to international radios on late April/May becoming the last hit of the band. The album was a compilation of thirteen singles, which each one of them made the top twenty in at least one country and three new tracks, two of them were written by the band members. Promotion for the album was slow, the band did a few shows in Sweden and international interviews to magazines. Many were reporting the band was splitting up after six years in the pop world. The band quickly denied the rumours on their official website. The single became another top-two hit for the band in Sweden, it became one of the band's biggest hits in South America (especially in Argentina) and the album became the band's first to not make the top ten in their homeland while it brought back the attention to them in other countries in Latin America and Eastern Europe. The album was just released in selected European countries, Asia and Latin America. It did not receive a U.S. release, although, when MCA Records went bankrupt and was absorbed by both Geffen and Interscope, the former had plans to release it in November, ready for the Christmas sales, but plans were scrapped when the band finished their tour and Dhani released his first solo single.
