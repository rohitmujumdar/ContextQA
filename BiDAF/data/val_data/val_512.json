{"paragraphs": [{"context": "The catchphrase most used by Laurel and Hardy on film is: \"Well, here's another nice mess you've gotten me into!\" The phrase was earlier used by W. S. Gilbert in both The Mikado from 1885 and The Grand Duke from 1896. It was first used by Hardy in The Laurel-Hardy Murder Case in 1930. In popular culture the catchphrase is often misquoted as \"Well, here's another fine mess you've gotten me into.\" The misquoted version of the phrase was never used by Hardy and the misunderstanding stems from the title of their film Another Fine Mess. Numerous variations of the quote appeared on film. For example, in Chickens Come Home Ollie says impatiently to Stan \"Well....\" with Stan replying, \"Here's another nice mess I've gotten you into.\" The films Thicker than Water and The Fixer-Uppers use the phrase \"Well, here's another nice kettle of fish you pickled me in!\" In Saps at Sea the phrase becomes \"Well, here's another nice bucket of suds you've gotten me into!\" Another regular catchphrase, cried out by Ollie in moments of distress or frustration, as Stan stands helplessly by, is \"Why don't you do something to help me?\" And another, not-as-often used catchphrase of Ollie, particularly after Stan has accidentally given a verbal idea to an adversary of theirs to torment them even more: \"Why don't you keep your (big) mouth shut?!\" \"D'oh!\" was a catchphrase used by the mustachioed Scottish actor James Finlayson who appeared in 33 Laurel and Hardy films. The phrase, expressing surprise, impatience, or incredulity, was the inspiration for \"D'oh!\" as spoken by the actor Dan Castelleneta portraying the character Homer Simpson in the long-running animated comedy The Simpsons. Homer's first intentional use of \"d'oh!\" occurred in the Ullman short \"Punching Bag\" (1988).

The duo's signature tune is known variously as \"The Cuckoo Song\", \"Ku-Ku\", or \"The Dance of the Cuckoos\".", "title": "Laurel and Hardy"}
