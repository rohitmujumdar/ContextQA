{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Jerry Wexler with co-producer Tom Dowd tried producing Sam & Dave in New York, with Atlantic songwriters and musicians. It took eight months to issue \"Ooh, Ooh, Ooh\", the first Atlantic single in August 1969. It was not a very good record, by Sam's own admission, and it represented the first time in four years that a Sam & Dave single failed to chart. Two more singles followed in 1970, \"Baby, Baby, Don't Stop Now,\" and \"One Part Love, Two Parts Pain.\" The first was a leftover Hayes-Porter recording from Stax; the second was produced by Wexler and Dowd in New York, and was written by Stax executive Al Bell and Allen Jones. Both failed to chart. According to Wexler, \"We just made some shit-ass records with them. I never really got into their sensibilities as a producer.\" Wexler then sent the duo south to Muscle Shoals and Miami to work with producers Brad Shapiro and Dave Crawford for their next single \"Knock It Out The Park,\" which also failed to chart. Sam & Dave split in June 1970, according to Moore as a result of Moore's dissatisfaction with the duo and his desire to pursue a career solo. According to Prater, they broke up because \"[Moore] decided to do what he wanted to do on his own.\" Moore recorded three solo singles (none of which charted) for Atlantic over the next year and was preparing an album produced by King Curtis, which was shelved after Curtis was stabbed to death in 1971. Prater recorded a single for Alston. Neither was commercially successful as a solo act, and they reunited in August 1971. In October 1971, their last Atlantic single, \"Don't Pull Your Love,\" was a cover of a hit by Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds. This Shapiro/Crawford production was a minor hit (R&B #36/Pop #102), but not a substantial enough commercial success to keep the duo signed to the label. Sam & Dave recorded four final songs for Atlantic in August, 1972, none of which was released by the label. Their contract with Atlantic expired shortly thereafter.
