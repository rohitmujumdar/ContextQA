{"paragraphs": [{"context": "As a friend of punk rock trio Green Day, he appeared in the \"When I Come Around\" video, where he is seen kissing a girl (his real-life girlfriend at the time). In 1994, White joined punk quartet Pinhead Gunpowder after the departure of singer/guitarist Sarah Kirsch (with whom White had played the previous year in Sixteen Bullets). When Green Day/Pinhead Gunpowder lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong founded Adeline Records in 1997, White helped him run it. He re-appeared with Armstrong for two Green Day shows in 1999, both of which raised money for the Bridge School Benefit. With the release of American Idiot, White was required again to play with the band during the supporting tour of the album. In February 2005, Jason got married. That year, he played with Green Day in their video, \"Wake Me Up When September Ends\"--the first time that any musician outside the trio appeared as a performer in a Green Day video. He also appears along the band in their 2005 live CD/DVD Bullet in a Bible. In April 2007, White and his wife joined Armstrong and his family in their Spring Break working with Habitat For Humanity and writing a diary for fan site GreenDay.net. In 2008, White joined Green Day's side project Foxboro Hot Tubs as lead guitarist along with Kevin Preston of Prima Donna on rhythm guitar. In 2009, he toured with Green Day in support for their latest record, 21st Century Breakdown. White made his fourth appearance on a Green Day video for \"21 Guns\" and his fifth in \"Last of the American Girls\"; prior to this, and not including his live appearances on \"Jesus of Suburbia\" and \"East Jesus Nowhere\", he had appeared in three videos: \"When I Come Around\", \"Wake Me Up When September Ends\", and \"Working Class Hero\". On July 13, 2010, Max Recordings released White's debut 45 single--\"Hungover\" b/w \"I'm a Mess\". He appeared once again as Green Day's sideman for their 2011 live album Awesome As Fuck. White is credited with contributing \"Guitar\" in the press release of Green Day's ninth, tenth, and eleventh studio albums !Uno!, !Dos!, and !Tre! In addition, he appears in photographs with the band. It was announced that White would feature on the cover of the soundtrack for a documentary on the making of the trilogy called !Cuatro!. Despite his promotion to a regular band member, he was not inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2016, White returned to his role as a touring member of Green Day and the band recorded their twelfth studio album Revolution Radio as their classic three-piece lineup.
