{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Joko Widodo's administration has vowed to develop and upgrade Indonesia's infrastructure, with a focus on road and railway expansion, seaports and airports development, and irrigation. In 2016, the state budget allocated Rp 290 trillion (US$22 billion) for infrastructure, the biggest infrastructure allocation in Indonesian history. There has been confusion and a start-stop approach on establishing a high-speed train between Jakarta and Bandung using either Japanese or Chinese sponsorship. In late September 2015, Indonesia awarded this multibillion-dollar railway project to China, to Japan's expressed disappointment. Indonesia's transportation ministry laid out a litany of shortcomings in plans for a $5.5 billion China-funded high-speed railway, casting doubt on the project and spotlighting Joko Widodo's limits in turning mega-projects into reality as he tries to draw foreign investors to Southeast Asia's largest economy. In early 2018 in his controversial statement, former presidential contender who lost the presidential election in 2014 and current Gerindra Party chairman Prabowo Subianto contended that if Indonesia continues to build its infrastructure at its rate under President Joko Widodo's administration, Indonesia would disintegrate by the year 2030.  The unproven remarks were neither scientifically backed, nor had any merits. It clearly lacked empirical evidence as speculation pointed to his public fear-mongering to counter President Joko Widodo's successful policies, as Subianto attempted for his second run for the presidency in the 2019 presidential election. Moreover, to add to the negativity the media also inflamed the public's concern about the government's aggressive infrastructure projects, fearing out-of-control public/national debt.  Although as of early 2018 the national debt climbed to over Rp. 4000 trillion, this figure was often taken out of context by the media as it was not compared to the gross-domestic-product (GDP) figure as nation debt-to-GDP ration, what economists and most experts use to determine the level of economic health and sustainability.  When the same national debt figure of Rp. 4.038 trillion compared to the consistently growing GDP, the national debt-to-GDP ratio itself remained at 27% of GDP as of early 2018, which was well below the 30% of GDP indicator for a sustainable economic growth and far below the 60% of GDP indicator allowed by the Constitution. The media was mainly to blame for this miscommunication to the public as most often information dissemination in Indonesia is taken out of context and media sensationalization.
