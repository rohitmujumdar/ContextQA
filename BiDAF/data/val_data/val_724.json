{"paragraphs": [{"context": "She then began dating Kevin Gilbert and joined him in an ad hoc group of musicians known to themselves as the \"Tuesday Music Club.\" Group members Gilbert, David Baerwald, and David Ricketts (both formerly of David & David), Bill Bottrell, Brian MacLeod, and Dan Schwartz share songwriting credits with Crow on her debut album, Tuesday Night Music Club. The group existed as a casual songwriting collective prior to its association with Crow but rapidly developed into a vehicle for her debut album after her arrival. Her relationship with Gilbert became acrimonious soon after the album was released, and disputes arose about songwriting credits. Crow appeared in the \"New Faces\" section of Rolling Stone in 1994. Tuesday Night Music Club featured many of the songs written by Crow's friends, including the second single, \"Leaving Las Vegas\". The album was slow to garner attention, until \"All I Wanna Do\" became an unexpected smash hit in the fall of 1994. As she later stated in People, she found an old poetry book in a used book store in the L.A. area and used a poem as lyrics in the song. The singles \"Strong Enough\" and \"Can't Cry Anymore\" were also released, with the first song (\"Strong Enough\") charting at No. 5 on Billboard and \"Can't Cry Anymore\" hitting the Top 40. Tuesday Night Music Club went on to sell more than 7 million copies in the U.S. and U.K. during the 1990s. The album also won Crow three Grammy Awards, in 1995: Record of the Year, Best New Artist and Best Female Vocal Performance. She performed at the 1994 and 1999 Woodstock Festivals, as well as the Another Roadside Attraction in 1997. Crow supplied background vocals to the song \"The Garden of Allah\" from Don Henley's 1995 album Actual Miles: Henley's Greatest Hits. In 1996, Crow released her self-titled second album. The album had songs about abortion, homelessness and nuclear war. She produced the album herself and also played a variety of instruments, from various guitars, bass or pedal steel to various organs and piano. The debut single, \"If It Makes You Happy\", became a radio success and netted her two Grammy awards for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance and Best Rock Album. Other singles included \"A Change Would Do You Good\", \"Home\", and \"Everyday Is a Winding Road\". The album was banned from sale at Wal-Mart, because in the lyrics to \"Love Is a Good Thing\" Crow says that Wal-Mart sells guns to children.  The album also features a protest song called \"Redemption Day\", which was covered by Johnny Cash on his last album American VI: Ain't No Grave. In 1997, Crow contributed the theme song to the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies. Her song \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" was nominated for a Grammy Award and Best Original Song Golden Globe. Crow collaborated on Scott Weiland's 1998 album, 12 Bar Blues.
