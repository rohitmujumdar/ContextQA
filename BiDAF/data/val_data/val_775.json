{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Lydia Maria Child wrote of the Abenaki in her short story, \"The Church in the Wilderness\" (1828). Several Abenaki characters and much about their 18th-century culture are featured in the Kenneth Roberts novel Arundel (1930). The film Northwest Passage (1940) is based on a novel of the same name by Roberts. Modern Abenaki writers as well as historical Abenaki-written documents are featured in the anthology Dawnland Voices, edited by Siobhan Senier. The collection features commonly known and less known modern writers as well as historical documents from Abenakis and their ancestors. The collection also includes writings from several other native New England tribes. The Abenaki are featured in Charles McCarry's historical novel Bride of the Wilderness (1988), and James Archibald Houston's novel Ghost Fox (1977), both of which are set in the eighteenth century; and in Jodi Picoult's Second Glance (2003) and Lone Wolf (2012) novels, set in the contemporary world. Books for younger readers both have historical settings: Joseph Bruchac's The Arrow Over the Door (1998) (grades 4-6) is set in 1777; and Beth Kanell's young adult novel, The Darkness Under the Water (2008), concerns a young Abenaki-French Canadian girl during the time of the Vermont Eugenics Project, 1931-1936. The first sentence in Norman Mailer's novel Harlot's Ghost makes reference to the Abenaki: \"On a late-winter evening in 1983, while driving through fog along the Maine coast, recollections of old campfires began to drift into the March mist, and I thought of the Abnaki Indians of the Algonquin tribe who dwelt near Bangor a thousand years ago.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "y", "question": "Were there novels written about them", "answers": [{"text": "The Abenaki are featured in Charles McCarry's historical novel", "answer_start": 672}, {"text": "The Abenaki are featured in Charles McCarry's historical novel Bride of the Wilderness", "answer_start": 672}, {"text": "Lydia Maria Child wrote of the Abenaki in her short story, \"The Church in the Wilderness\" (1828).", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Lydia Maria Child wrote of the Abenaki in her short story, \"", "answer_start": 0}], "id": "C_bf5f12e3c7f9449395465e8a85143afa_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "Lydia Maria Child wrote of the Abenaki in her short story, \"", "answer_start": 0}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "what was the name of the short story", "answers": [{"text": "The Church in the Wilderness", "answer_start": 60}, {"text": "\"The Church in the Wilderness\" (", "answer_start": 59}, {"text": "\"The Church in the Wilderness\" (1828).", "answer_start": 59}, {"text": "\"The Church in the Wilderness", "answer_start": 59}], "id": "C_bf5f12e3c7f9449395465e8a85143afa_0_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "\"The Church in the Wilderness", "answer_start": 59}}, {"followup": "m", "yesno": "x", "question": "what was the story about", "answers": [{"text": "the Abenaki", "answer_start": 27}, {"text": "the Abenaki", "answer_start": 27}, {"text": "about their 18th-century culture", "answer_start": 134}], "id": "C_bf5f12e3c7f9449395465e8a85143afa_0_q#2", "orig_answer": {"text": "about their 18th-century culture", "answer_start": 134}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "was the story well known", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1633}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1633}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1633}], "id": "C_bf5f12e3c7f9449395465e8a85143afa_0_q#3", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1633}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "what writers were involved", "answers": [{"text": "Modern Abenaki writers as well as historical Abenaki-written documents", "answer_start": 308}, {"text": "commonly known and less known modern writers", "answer_start": 476}, {"text": "commonly known and less known modern writers", "answer_start": 476}, {"text": "documents from Abenakis and their ancestors.", "answer_start": 543}], "id": "C_bf5f12e3c7f9449395465e8a85143afa_0_q#4", "orig_answer": {"text": "documents from Abenakis and their ancestors.", "answer_start": 543}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What else is important about the story", "answers": [{"text": "The Abenaki are featured in Charles McCarry's historical novel", "answer_start": 672}, {"text": "The Abenaki are featured in Charles McCarry's historical novel Bride of the Wilderness", "answer_start": 672}, {"text": "as well as historical documents from Abenakis and their ancestors.
