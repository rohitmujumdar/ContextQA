{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In April 1999, Texas released the first single from their forthcoming fifth studio album. \"In Our Lifetime\" peaked at No. 4 on the UK Singles Charts and was also included on the Notting Hill film soundtrack that year. The band's fifth album, The Hush, was released in May 1999 and charted at No. 1 on the UK Album Charts in its first week of release. A second single, \"Summer Son\", was released in August 1999, reaching No. 5, the band's seventh UK Top 10 single at that point. A third and final single, \"When We Are Together\", was released in November 1999 and narrowly missed the UK Top 10 (peaking at 12). The album was certified 3 x Platinum by the BPI for UK sales in excess of 900,000 copies. In October 2000, Texas released their first compilation album, The Greatest Hits. The album featured tracks spanning their career, from their 1989 debut to the current day and included three new songs. A new single, \"In Demand\" was released on 2 October 2000 and reached No. 6 in the UK, with a video that featured the actor Alan Rickman. When The Greatest Hits was released, it became the band's third consecutive album to debut at No. 1 in the UK. A second new single from the collection, \"Inner Smile\", was released at the end of 2000, also reaching No. 6 on the UK Singles Charts. The video for \"Inner Smile\" featured a homage to Elvis Presley (and specifically his '68 Comeback Special shows) with lead singer Sharleen Spiteri dressed and made up to look like Elvis in his famous black leather suit. In July 2001, a remix of \"I Don't Want A Lover\" was released which made the UK Top 20. By this time, The Greatest Hits album had become a huge success and was eventually certified 6 x Platinum by the BPI for UK sales in excess of 1.8 million copies. The single \"Like Lovers (Holding On)\" was featured during the closing credits of the 2000 animated feature film Titan A.E and also appears briefly in one scene as background music. The song was included on the Titan A.E. soundtrack as well.
