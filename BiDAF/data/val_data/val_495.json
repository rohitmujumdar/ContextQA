{"paragraphs": [{"context": "With the demise of the Black Cat, Sarria helped found the Society for Individual Rights (SIR) in 1963. SIR grew out of a split between Sarria and Strait over the direction that LCE was heading. Strait and his supporters wanted to focus more on publishing the group's newsletter, while Sarria and his backers wanted to maintain focus on street-level organizing. SIR sponsored both social and political functions, including bowling leagues, bridge clubs, voter registration drives and \"Candidates' Nights\" and published its own magazine, Vector. In association with the Tavern Guild, SIR printed and distributed \"Pocket Lawyers\". These pocket-sized guides offered advice on what to do if arrested or harassed by police. SIR lasted for 17 years. Crowned Queen of the Beaux Arts Ball in 1964 by the Tavern Guild, Sarria, stating that he was \"already a queen\", proclaimed himself \"Her Royal Majesty, Empress of San Francisco, Jose I, The Widow Norton\". Sarria devised the name \"Widow Norton\" as a reference to the much-celebrated citizen of 19th century San Francisco, Joshua Norton, who had declared himself Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico in 1859. Sarria organized elaborate annual pilgrimages to lay flowers on Norton's grave in the Woodlawn Cemetery in Colma, California. He purchased a plot adjacent to Norton's where he is now interred. Sarria's assumption of the title of Empress led to the establishment of the Imperial Court System, a network of non-profit charitable organizations throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico that raises money for various beneficiaries. Sarria is much revered within the hierarchy of the Imperial Court System and is affectionately and informally known as \"Mama\" or \"Mama Jose\" among Imperial Court members. The \"Jose Honors Awards\" are presented to Imperial Court dignitaries and others in a bi-annual banquet held in Sarria's honor.
