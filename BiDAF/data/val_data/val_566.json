{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Winfrey interviewed Kathy Bray three weeks after her 10-year-old son, Scott, was accidentally killed by a friend who had found his father's gun. Viewers later commented that the interview changed their feelings about having guns in their homes. In the 1989-90 season, Truddi Chase--a woman who was diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, having 92 distinct personalities--appeared on the show. Chase had been violently and sexually abused beginning at the age of two and said her old self ceased to exist after that. After introducing Chase, who was there to promote her book When Rabbit Howls, Winfrey unexpectedly broke down in tears while reading the teleprompter, relating her own childhood molestation to that of the guest. Unable to control herself, Winfrey repeatedly asked producers to stop filming. Erin Kramp, a mother dying of breast cancer, appeared on the show in 1998. After realizing that her six-year-old daughter, Peyton, would have to grow up without her, Kramp began recording videotapes filled with motherly advice on everything from makeup tips to finding a husband. She also wrote letters and bought gifts for Peyton to open every Christmas and birthday she was gone. Kramp lost her battle with cancer on October 31, 1998. She had recorded over a hundred videos and audiotapes for her daughter. Jo Ann Compton's daughter Laurie Ann was stabbed to death in 1988--and a decade later, the mom was tangled in her grief. \"I hope they're in the same hell I'm in.\" she said of her daughter's murderers on a 1998 show. Oprah brought in Dr. Phil to help Jo Ann. He asked her if she thought her daughter would want her to be in so much pain--and Compton said no. \"Maybe the betrayal is focusing on the day of her death, rather than celebrating the event of her life.\" Phil continued. \"She lived for 18 vibrant years, and you focus on the day she died.\" After a moment, Compton uttered her breakthrough sentence: \"I never thought of it that way.\" Later, she sobbed while revealing that she had been planning to end her life after the show. When Compton returned to the show in 2011, she had a new viewpoint on the daughter she lost: \"She continues to stay alive every time I do something positive.\" Compton's surviving daughter, Cindy, said \"She went from existing to living. It was an amazing transformation.\" In 2001, Winfrey met 11-year-old Mattie Stepanek, who was born with dysautonomic mitochondrial myopathy and wrote inspirational poetry he titled \"Heartsongs.\" On the show, Stepanek stated, \"A heartsong doesn't have to be a song in your heart. It doesn't have to be talking about love and peace. ... It's your message, what you feel like you need to do.\" In October 2008, Winfrey spoke at the posthumous dedication of Mattie J.T Stepanek Park in Maryland.
