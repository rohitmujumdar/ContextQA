{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Snow moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1945, and \"Hank Snow, the Singing Ranger\" (modified from his earlier nickname, the Yodeling Ranger), began recording for RCA Victor in the United States in 1949. His first release in the United States, \"Marriage Vow\" climbed to number ten on the country charts in the fall of 1949; However, it wasn't until he was invited to play at the Grand Ole Opry in 1950 that he gained serious significance in the United States. His second release in early 1950, \"I'm Moving On\" was the first of seven number 1 hits on the country charts. \"I'm Moving On\" stayed at the top for 21 weeks, setting the all-time record for most weeks at number 1. That same year \"The Golden Rocket\" and \"The Rhumba Boogie\" both hit number one with the latter remaining No. 1 for eight weeks. Along with these hits, his other \"signature song\" was \"I've Been Everywhere\", in which he portrayed himself as a hitchhiker bragging about all the towns he'd been through. This song was originally written and performed in Australia by Geoff Mack, and its re-write incorporated North American place names. Rattling off a well-rhymed series of city names at an auctioneer's pace has long made the song a challenge for any singer. While performing in Renfro Valley, Snow worked with a young Hank Williams. In the February 7th 1953 edition, Billboard Magazine reported that Snow's then seventeen-year-old son, Jimmy Rodgers Snow, had signed with RCA Victor and that the younger Snow would \"record duets with his father\", as well as cover his own (presumably ghost-written) material.
