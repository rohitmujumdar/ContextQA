{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In January 1993, an article in one of Norway's biggest newspapers, Bergens Tidende (BT), brought the black metal scene into the media spotlight. Two friends of Vikernes interviewed him and brought the interview to the newspaper, hoping they would print it. In the anonymous interview, 'Count Grishnackh' (Vikernes) claimed to have burnt the churches and killed a man in Lillehammer. BT journalist Finn Bjorn Tonder set up a meeting with 'Count Grishnackh', with help from the friends. The journalists were summoned to an apartment and reportedly warned that they would be shot if the police were called. There, Vikernes and his companions told the journalists that they had burnt the churches, or knew who had done it, and said that the attacks would continue. They claimed to be Devil worshippers and said: \"Our intention is to spread fear and devilry [...] that is why we are telling this to Bergens Tidende.\" They gave the journalists details about the arsons that hadn't been released to the press and so BT spoke with the police before publishing it, who confirmed these details. The article was published on 20 January as the front page of the BT. It was headlined \"We Lit The Fires\" and included a photo of Vikernes, his face mostly hidden, holding two large knives. However, by the time the article was printed, Vikernes had already been arrested. The police allegedly found him by going to an address printed on a Burzum flyer, although Vikernes believes that Tonder \"snitched\" on him. According to Vikernes, the anonymous interview was planned by himself and Euronymous. The goal, he says, was to scare people, promote black metal and get more customers for Helvete. At the time, Burzum was about to release the Aske mini-album. Vikernes said of the interview: \"I exaggerated a lot and when the journalist left we [...] had a good laugh, because he didn't seem to understand that I was pulling his leg\". He added that the interview revealed nothing that could prove his involvement in any crime. Vikernes claims that, after he was arrested, \"the journalist edited the interview and [...] published an insane version of it the following day, without even letting me read through it.\" Some of the other scene members were also arrested and questioned, but all were released for lack of evidence. Jorn Inge Tunsberg of Hades said that the interview had \"grave consequences\" for the rest of the scene and that they did not know he was going to talk to the press, as \"he had said nothing\". He added that they became \"bloody angry\" and he, Tunsberg, was \"pissed off\". Norwegian magazine Rock Furore published an interview with Vikernes in February 1993. In it, he said of the prison system: \"It's much too nice here. It's not hell at all. In this country prisoners get a bed, toilet and shower. It's completely ridiculous. I asked the police to throw me in a real dungeon, and also encouraged them to use violence\". He was released in March for lack of evidence.
