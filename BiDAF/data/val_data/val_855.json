{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 1975, Tyler persuaded the parents of 16-year-old groupie Julia Holcomb (sometimes spelled Holcolm) to sign over guardianship to him so that he could live with her in Boston. They dated and took drugs together for three years. Holcomb was referred to as \"Diana Hall\" by the editor of the Aerosmith autobiography Walk This Way in an attempt to conceal her identity, but other sources have confirmed her identity. Pressures leading to their split included their age difference (Tyler was 27 when they first met), a withdrawn proposal, a house fire, and a planned pregnancy that resulted in an abortion when Tyler was worried that the fire's smoke and drugs might lead to birth defects. Band member Ray Tabano wrote in Walk This Way that the abortion \"really messed Steven up\" because the child was a boy. Tyler wrote, \"It was a big crisis. It's a major thing when you're growing something with a woman, but they convinced us that it would never work out and would ruin our lives. You go to the doctor and they put the needle in her belly and they squeeze the stuff in and you watch. And it comes out dead. I was pretty devastated. In my mind, I'm going, Jesus, what have I done?\" However, Julia Holcomb has said that Tyler was snorting cocaine while watching the abortion and offered some to her. Julia Holcomb revealed her regret for having the abortion, joined the Silent No More organization of women who have regretted their abortions, and converted to Catholicism.
