{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Dion is often regarded as one of pop music's most influential voices. According to Linda Lister in Divafication: The Deification of Modern Female Pop Stars, she has been described as a reigning \"Queen of Pop\" for her influence over the record industry during the 1990s, alongside other female entertainers, including Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. In a countdown of the \"22 Greatest Voices in Music\" by Blender Magazine and MTV, she placed ninth (sixth for a female), and she was also placed fourth in Cover Magazineis list of \"The 100 Outstanding Pop Vocalists.\" Dion is often compared to Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston for her vocal style and to her idol, Barbra Streisand, for her voice. Dion possesses a three-octave range, from B2 to E6. Dion once stated that she is a mezzo-soprano. However, attempts to adapt classical voice types to other forms of singing have been met with controversy. Without making a classification, maestro Kent Nagano remarked, \"All you just sang was full lyric soprano\", after Dion auditioned with two solos from Carmen, wanting to know if she could sing opera. Her timbre has been described as \"thin, slightly nasal\" with a \"raspy\" lower register and \"bell glass-like high notes\". Dion is often praised for her technical virtuosity. Jim Santella of The Buffalo News writes \"Like an iron fist in a velvet glove, the power of Celine Dion's voice is cloaked in a silky vibrato that betrays the intensity of her vocal commitment.\" Jeff Miers, also of The Buffalo News, says of Dion \"Her singing voice is absolutely extra-human. She hits notes in full voice, with a controlled vibrato and an incredible conception of pitch, like she's shucking an ear of corn\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times states that Dion has \"a good-sized arsenal of technical skills. She can deliver tricky melismas, produce expressive vocal catches and sustain long notes without the tiniest wavering of pitch. And as her duets ... have shown, she is a reliable harmony voice.\" In an interview with Liberation, Jean-Jacques Goldman notes that she has \"no problem of accuracy or tempo\". According to Kent Nagano, maestro of the Munich Symphony Orchestra, Dion is \"a musician who has a good ear, a refinement, and a degree of perfection that is enviable\". Charles Alexander of Time states, \"[Her] voice glides effortlessly from deep whispers to dead-on high notes, a sweet siren that combines force with grace.\" In her French repertoire, Dion adorns her vocals with more nuances and expressiveness, with the emotional intensity being \"more tender and intimate\". Additionally, Luc Plamondon, a French singer-songwriter who has worked closely with Dion claims that there are three chanteuses (stylistically) that Dion uses: the Quebecois, the French, and the American. Her self-titled album was promoted with the slogan \"Remember the name because you'll never forget the voice.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What can you tell me about Celines Voice", "answers": [{"text": "Her timbre has been described as \"thin, slightly nasal\" with a \"raspy\" lower register and \"bell glass-like high notes\".", "answer_start": 1099}, {"text": "possesses a three-octave range, from B2 to E6.", "answer_start": 701}, {"text": "Dion is often regarded as one of pop music's most influential voices.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "\"22 Greatest Voices in Music\" by Blender Magazine and MTV, she placed ninth (sixth for a female),", "answer_start": 373}, {"text": "Dion possesses a three-octave range, from B2 to E6.
