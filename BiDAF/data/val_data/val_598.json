{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 2001, Sony Nashville transferred Diffie from its Epic division to the Monument Records division. This move was due to a corporate decision that Epic had too many artists and Monument had too few. Cook and Wilson also produced his only album for Monument, which was titled In Another World. Regarding this album, Diffie told Billboard that its material had a common theme of love, and that he wanted to create a more contemporary sound through the production. The album's title track peaked at number ten on the country charts and number 66 on the Hot 100. Only one other single was released from the album: \"This Pretender\" (co-written by Rascal Flatts lead singer Gary LeVox), which failed to make the country music Top 40. In Another World received mixed reviews. Country Weekly reviewer wrote that Diffie \"deals with adult emotions\" and described the title track as \"a shimmering ballad perfect for his expressive tenor.\" William Ruhlmann called the album \"sturdy formula country\", and Jeffrey B. Remz of Country Standard Time said that he \"easily interpret[s]\" the songs but \"doesn't seem to be doing anything too dramatically different.\" After Monument closed its Nashville branch, Diffie began touring with Mark Chesnutt and Tracy Lawrence on the Rockin' Roadhouse Tour, which began in 2002. That same year, Diffie was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame. Diffie signed to the independent Broken Bow Records in 2003. His only album for the label was Tougher Than Nails, which he and Wilson produced with Buddy Cannon. It included five songs that Diffie co-wrote, as well as a duet with George Jones entitled \"What Would Waylon Do\". Tougher Than Nails produced a Top 20 hit in its title track, followed by \"If I Could Only Bring You Back\", which peaked at number 50 and spent only eight weeks on the charts. This latter song was also his last charting single. Erlewine said of the album's content, \"there's nothing new, but there doesn't need to be\", and Country Standard Time said that the album \"shows that he's still got the talent that took him to stardom in the first place.\" In 2005, Jo Dee Messina released \"My Give a Damn's Busted\", which Diffie co-wrote and originally recorded on In Another World. Her version of the song, included on her album Delicious Surprise, was a number one single that year.
