{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Following the success of Right Now, a new album, Feels So Good, was recorded. The songwriting and production agreement with Andy McCluskey and Stuart Kershaw was an increasing source of tension within the group, and the pair departed during the recording of the album. McCluskey spoke of dissension between himself and the record company, whose \"formula\" demanded \"'Whole Again', 'Whole Again' and more fucking 'Whole Again'\"; he was essentially dismissed and legally prohibited from contacting the band, before exiting the \"very dirty\" business of \"manufactured pop\". Released tracks from Feels So Good were \"It's OK\", \"The Tide Is High (Get the Feeling)\", \"The Last Goodbye\",\"Love Doesn't Have to Hurt\", and \"Be With You\". The unreleased single was \"Feels So Good\" sung by Kylie Minogue and Atomic Kitten. \"The Last Goodbye\" was the 3rd single from their second studio album, Feels So Good and \"Be With You\" was from their third album, Ladies Night. The first single, \"It's OK\", peaked at number three in the United Kingdom. The next single was \"The Tide Is High (Get the Feeling)\", a remake of the 1965 song by The Paragons that Blondie covered in 1980, which gave the group their third number-one single in the UK and New Zealand. In April 2002 Hamilton announced that she was pregnant but opted to continue with the scheduled 2002 tour, appear in the \"Tide is High (Get the Feeling)\" video, and appear at Party in the Park before going on maternity leave. the single \"(I Wanna Be Like) Other Girls\" was from the Disney movie Mulan II. There was also a Feels So Good Medley live at Party in the Park including \"Be With You\", \"The Tide Is High (Get The Feeling)\", It's OK\", \"Feels So Good\", \"The Moment You Leave Me\", \"Walking on the Water\", and \"The Last Goodbye\". During January and February 2003, Atomic Kitten toured Southeast Asia, visiting Singapore, Thailand, and Korea. Hamilton, who had given birth to her son Josh on 24 August 2002, brought him on the tour. In 2002 the band sponsored a team in the British Touring Car Championship.
