{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Anderson ran for Mayor of Salt Lake City in 1999, defeating 10 other candidates in the primary campaign, before winning 60% of the vote in the general election against opponent Stuart Reid. He won re-election by a 7% margin against Frank Pignanelli in 2003. Anderson's two terms in office were extremely eventful, with Anderson playing a leading role in hosting the 2002 Winter Olympic Games; He organized and co-hosted dozens of mayors for three consecutive years at the Sundance Summit. He also founded the Salt Lake City International Jazz Festival, as well as providing national and international leadership regarding climate protection. He conducted a successful national campaign to require that airports across the country screen all checked luggage, expanded the area's light rail system, significantly expanded protected open space, implemented an innovative and highly successful Restorative justice program and created a city wide after-school and summer youth program. Many of Anderson's achievements were described in his State of the City addresses and listed in a document provided to the public shortly before he left office. State Senator Chris Buttars of West Jordan publicly denounced former Mayor Rocky Anderson for having \"attracted the entire gay community to come and live in Salt Lake County\" after a Dan Jones poll indicated strong support for allowing domestic partnerships. In the 2004 election, 63% of the city population voted against banning same-sex marriage, in agreement with Mayor Anderson. Anderson chose not to run for a third term to be able to push for reforms of U.S. human rights policies and practices through grassroots organizing.
