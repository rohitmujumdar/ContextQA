{"paragraphs": [{"context": "On August 10, 2005, Pirro announced that she would seek the Republican nomination to challenge first-term incumbent senator Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, in the 2006 election for U.S. Senator from New York. Other Republicans who announced campaigns for the nomination were John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers, William Brenner, an attorney in Sullivan County, and attorney Edward Cox, the son-in-law of former president Richard Nixon. In a widely publicized moment when she was declaring her candidacy, Pirro misplaced page 10 of her speech and went silent for 32 seconds, something that is widely considered to have damaged her campaign before it even started. During an appearance at the Crime Victims Resource Center, Pirro described herself this way: \"I am red on fiscal policy. I am conservative and I support the Bush tax cut.\" She added, however: \"I have broad blue stripes when it comes to social issues... I am a woman who is a moderate in New York.\" Republican governor George Pataki's endorsement of Pirro caused Cox to withdraw from the race, leaving Pirro as the likely nominee. Donors to Pirro's political campaign included designer Tommy Hilfiger (also a native of Elmira) and Donald Trump, as well as contractors and real estate executives who had done business with her husband. On December 21, 2005, Pirro dropped out of the Senate race after continuing pressure from party chiefs. This decision was reached after a lagging fundraising effort and polls that showed she would be easily defeated by Clinton (a Quinnipiac University poll found Pirro would lose to Clinton 62 percent to 30 percent). In a statement, she said \"I have decided that my law enforcement background better qualifies me for a race for New York State attorney general than a race for the United States Senate.\" Spencer was eventually chosen as the Republican Party's nominee for the U.S. Senate.
