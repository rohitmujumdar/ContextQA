{"paragraphs": [{"context": "According to Beatles biographer John T. Marck, \"Real Love\" originated as part of an unfinished stage play that Lennon was working on at the time, titled The Ballad of John and Yoko. The song was first recorded in 1977 with a handheld tape recorder on his piano at home. Eventually the work evolved under the title \"Real Life\", a song which Lennon would record at least six times in 1979 and 1980, and then abandoned. The song was eventually combined with elements of another Lennon demo, \"Baby Make Love to You\". In June 1978, Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono told the press that they were working on a musical, The Ballad of John and Yoko, which had been planned during the previous year. Songs proposed to be included up to this point were \"Real Love\" and \"Every Man Has a Woman Who Loves Him\". In later versions, Lennon altered portions of the song; for example, \"no need to be alone / it's real love / yes, it's real love\" became \"why must it be alone / it's real / well it's real life.\" Some takes included an acoustic guitar, while the eventual Beatles release features Lennon on piano, with rudimentary double-tracked vocals, and a tambourine. The version released in 1996 most closely reflected the lyrical structure of the early demo takes of the song. Lennon appears to have considered recording \"Real Love\" for his and Ono's 1980 album Double Fantasy. A handwritten draft of the album's running order places it as the possible opening track on side two. The song remained largely forgotten until 1988, when the take 6 of \"Real Love\" appeared on the Imagine: John Lennon soundtrack album. The song was also released on the Acoustic album in 2004. The demo with just Lennon on piano was issued in 1998 on John Lennon Anthology and then later on Working Class Hero: The Definitive Lennon.
