{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Boris Yeltsin died of congestive heart failure on 23 April 2007, aged 76. According to experts quoted by Komsomolskaya Pravda, the onset of Yeltsin's condition was due to his visit to Jordan between 25 March and 2 April. He was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery on 25 April 2007, following a period during which his body had lain in repose in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow. Yeltsin was the first Russian head of state in 113 years to be buried in a church ceremony, after Emperor Alexander III. He was survived by his wife, Naina Iosifovna Yeltsina, whom he married in 1956, and their two daughters Yelena and Tatyana, born in 1957 and 1959, respectively. President Putin declared the day of his funeral a national day of mourning, with the nation's flags flown at half mast and all entertainment programs suspended for the day. Putin said, upon declaring 25 April 2007 a day of national mourning, that: [Yeltsin's] presidency has inscribed him forever in Russian and in world history. ... A new democratic Russia was born during his time: a free, open and peaceful country. A state in which the power truly does belong to the people. ... the first President of Russia's strength consisted in the mass support of Russian citizens for his ideas and aspirations. Thanks to the will and direct initiative of President Boris Yeltsin a new constitution, one which declared human rights a supreme value, was adopted. It gave people the opportunity to freely express their thoughts, to freely choose power in Russia, to realise their creative and entrepreneurial plans. This Constitution permitted us to begin building a truly effective Federation. ... We knew him as a brave and a warm-hearted, spiritual person. He was an upstanding and courageous national leader. And he was always very honest and frank while defending his position. ... [Yeltsin] assumed full responsibility for everything he called for, for everything he aspired to. For everything he tried to do and did do for the sake of Russia, for the sake of millions of Russians. And he invariably took upon himself, let it in his heart, all the trials and tribulations of Russia, peoples' difficulties and problems. Shortly after the news broke, former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev issued a statement, saying: \"I express my profoundest condolences to the family of the deceased, who had major deeds for the good of the country as well as serious mistakes behind him. It was a tragic destiny.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "How did Boris die?", "answers": [{"text": "congestive heart failure", "answer_start": 22}, {"text": "Boris Yeltsin died of congestive heart failure", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "congestive heart failure", "answer_start": 22}, {"text": "23 April 2007,", "answer_start": 50}], "id": "C_a722bf043d454060b25ef2d81081e05c_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "23 April 2007,", "answer_start": 50}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "what caused his death?", "answers": [{"text": "congestive heart failure", "answer_start": 22}, {"text": "Boris Yeltsin died of congestive heart failure", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "congestive heart failure", "answer_start": 22}, {"text": "congestive heart failure", "answer_start": 22}], "id": "C_a722bf043d454060b25ef2d81081e05c_0_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "congestive heart failure", "answer_start": 22}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "where was his funeral?", "answers": [{"text": "He was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery on 25 April 2007,", "answer_start": 221}, {"text": "He was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery on 25 April 2007,", "answer_start": 221}, {"text": "Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow.", "answer_start": 348}, {"text": "had lain in repose in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow.", "answer_start": 322}], "id": "C_a722bf043d454060b25ef2d81081e05c_0_q#2", "orig_answer": {"text": "had lain in repose in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow.", "answer_start": 322}}, {"followup": "n", "yesno": "x", "question": "how many people attended?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2469}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2469}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2469}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2469}], "id": "C_a722bf043d454060b25ef2d81081e05c_0_q#3", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2469}}, {"followup": "n", "yesno": "x", "question": "what else happened during his funeral?", "answers": [{"text": "President Putin declared the day of his funeral a national day of mourning, with the nation's flags flown at half mast and all entertainment programs suspended for the day.", "answer_start": 673}, {"text": "Yeltsin was the first Russian head of state in 113 years to be buried in a church ceremony,", "answer_start": 391}, {"text": "his body had lain in repose", "answer_start": 313}], "id": "C_a722bf043d454060b25ef2d81081e05c_0_q#4", "orig_answer": {"text": "his body had lain in repose", "answer_start": 313}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "what else is noteable about his death", "answers": [{"text": "Shortly after the news broke, former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev issued a statement, saying: \"I express my profoundest condolences to the family of the deceased,", "answer_start": 2189}, {"text": "President Putin declared the day of his funeral a national day of mourning,", "answer_start": 673}, {"text": "President Putin declared the day of his funeral a national day of mourning,", "answer_start": 673}, {"text": "President Putin declared the day of his funeral a national day of mourning, with the nation's flags flown at half mast and all entertainment programs suspended for the day.", "answer_start": 673}], "id": "C_a722bf043d454060b25ef2d81081e05c_0_q#5", "orig_answer": {"text": "President Putin declared the day of his funeral a national day of mourning, with the nation's flags flown at half mast and all entertainment programs suspended for the day.", "answer_start": 673}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "what else did Putin do?", "answers": [{"text": "Yeltsin's] presidency has inscribed him forever in Russian and in world history. ...
