{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Many other columnists began to write gossip soon after Winchell's initial success, such as Ed Sullivan in New York and Louella Parsons in Los Angeles. He wrote in a style filled with slang and incomplete sentences. Winchell's casual writing style famously earned him the ire of mobster Dutch Schultz, who confronted him at New York's Cotton Club and publicly lambasted him for using the phrase \"pushover\" to describe Schultz's penchant for blonde women. Some notable Winchell quotations are: \"Nothing recedes like success\", and \"I usually get my stuff from people who promised somebody else that they would keep it a secret\". Herman Klurfeld, a ghostwriter for Winchell for almost three decades, started writing to four newspaper columns per week for Winchell in 1936 and worked for him for 29 years. He also wrote many of the signature one-liners, called \"lasties\", that Mr. Winchell used at the end of his Sunday evening radio broadcasts. One of Klurfeld's quips was \"She's been on more laps than a napkin\". In 1952, the New York Post revealed Mr. Klurfeld as Mr. Winchell's ghostwriter.  (Klurfeld also wrote a biography of Winchell entitled Walter Winchell: His Life and Times, which was the basis for the 1998 movie Winchell.) Winchell opened his radio broadcasts by pressing randomly on a telegraph key, a sound that created a sense of urgency and importance, and using the catchphrase \"Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. America from border to border and coast to coast and all the ships at sea. Let's go to press.\" He would then read each of his stories with a staccato delivery (up to a rate of 197 words per minute, though he claimed a speed of well over 200 words per minute in an interview in 1967), noticeably faster than the typical pace of American speech. His diction also can be heard in his breathless narration of the Untouchables television series as well as in several Hollywood films.

Winchell showed a particular talent for finding embarrassing stories about famous people by exploiting his exceptionally wide circle of contacts, and trading gossip, sometimes in return for his silence. His uniquely outspoken style made him both feared and admired, and his column was syndicated worldwide. In the 1930s, he attacked the appeasers of Nazism, and later aligned with Joseph McCarthy in his campaign against communists.", "title": "Walter Winchell"}
