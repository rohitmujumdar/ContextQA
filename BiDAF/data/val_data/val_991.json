{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In the mid-1990s, Mario was signed to a production deal with Dallas Austin's Rowdy Records thru producers Tim & Bob. He lived with the duo at their house studio until his breakthrough came as a Christian songwriter, musician and co-producer on R. Kelly's \"I Can't Sleep Baby\" and \"You Remind Me of Something\" (plus three more songs) from the R. Kelly album in 1995. He also worked with Pebbles and 98 Degrees. Winans eventually released his debut album Story of My Heart on Motown in 1997. While the song \"Don't Know\" reached the US R&B top 50, the album failed to chart. Soon after, Winans teamed up with Sean Combs, then known as Puff Daddy and his Bad Boy roster, playing drums on \"Come with Me\" by Puff Daddy and Jimmy Page, based on the classic Led Zeppelin song \"Kashmir\" from their 1975 album Physical Graffiti, and featured on the soundtrack to the 1998 remake of Godzilla. Over the next several years Winans produced songs for Bad Boy artists including Diddy, The Notorious B.I.G., Lil' Kim, Faith Evans, Loon, Black Rob, and 112. He has also worked with notable artists outside Bad Boy including Destiny's Child, Mary J. Blige, Whitney Houston, Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, Tamia, Eminem and Brian McKnight. Winans co-wrote the two-part song \"I Need a Girl\" with P. Diddy and appeared on \"Pt. 2\" along with Loon, Ginuwine, and Diddy, which became a hit recording in 2002. He also produced the Bad Boy remix compilation We Invented the Remix in 2002.
