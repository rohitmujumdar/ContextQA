{"paragraphs": [{"context": "The group's fortunes changed in 1978, after the band released Some Girls (UK No. 2; US No. 1), which included the hit single \"Miss You\", the country ballad \"Far Away Eyes\", \"Beast of Burden\", and \"Shattered\". In part as a response to punk, many songs, particularly \"Respectable\", were fast, basic, guitar-driven rock and roll, and the album's success re-established the Rolling Stones' immense popularity among young people. Following the US Tour 1978, the band guested on the first show of the fourth season of the TV series Saturday Night Live. Following the success of Some Girls, the band released their next album Emotional Rescue (UK 1; US 1) in mid-1980. During the recording sessions of the album, a rift between Jagger and Richards was slowly beginning to form. Richards wanted to tour in summer or autumn of 1980 to promote the new album. Much to his disappointment, Jagger declined. Emotional Rescue hit the top of the charts on both sides of the Atlantic and the title track reached No.3 in the US. In early 1981, the group reconvened and decided to tour the US that year, leaving little time to write and record a new album, as well as rehearse for the tour. That year's resulting album, Tattoo You (UK 2; US 1), featured a number of outtakes, including lead single \"Start Me Up\", which reached No.2 in the US and ranked No.22 on Billboard's Hot 100 year-end chart. Two songs (\"Waiting on a Friend\" (US No. 13) and \"Tops\") featured Mick Taylor's unused rhythm guitar tracks, while jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins played on \"Slave\" and \"Waiting on a Friend\". The Rolling Stones scored one more top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1982, the No. 20 hit \"Hang Fire\". The Stones' American Tour 1981 was their biggest, longest and most colourful production to date, with the band playing from 25 September through 19 December. It was the highest grossing tour of that year. The tour included a concert at Chicago's Checkerboard Lounge with Muddy Waters, in what would be one of his last performances before his death in 1983. Some shows were recorded, resulting in the 1982 live album Still Life (American Concert 1981) (UK 4; US 5), and the 1983 Hal Ashby concert film Let's Spend the Night Together, which was filmed at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona and the Brendan Byrne Arena in the Meadowlands, New Jersey. In mid-1982, to commemorate their 20th anniversary, the Rolling Stones took their American stage show to Europe. The European Tour 1982 was their first European tour in six years, with a similar format to the American tour. The band were joined by former Allman Brothers Band keyboardist Chuck Leavell, who continues to perform and record with the Rolling Stones. By the end of the year, the band had signed a new four-album recording deal with a new label, CBS Records, for a reported $50 million, then the biggest record deal in history.
