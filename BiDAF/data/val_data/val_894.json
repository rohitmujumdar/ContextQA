{"paragraphs": [{"context": "O'Connor was a vigorous defender of the citing of foreign laws in judicial decisions. In a well-publicized October 28, 2003, speech at the Southern Center for International Studies, O'Connor said: The impressions we create in this world are important and can leave their mark ... [T]here is talk today about the \"internationalization of legal relations\". We are already seeing this in American courts, and should see it increasingly in the future. This does not mean, of course, that our courts can or should abandon their character as domestic institutions. But conclusions reached by other countries and by the international community, although not formally binding upon our decisions, should at times constitute persuasive authority in American courts--what is sometimes called \"transjudicialism\". In the speech she noted the 2002 Court case, Atkins v. Virginia, in which the majority decision (which included her) cited disapproval of the death penalty in Europe as part of its argument. This speech, and the general concept of relying on foreign law and opinion, was widely criticized by conservatives. In May 2004, the U.S. House of Representatives responded by passing a non-binding resolution, the \"Reaffirmation of American Independence Resolution\", stating that \"U.S. judicial decisions should not be based on any foreign laws, court decisions, or pronouncements of foreign governments unless they are relevant to determining the meaning of American constitutional and statutory law.\" O'Connor once quoted the constitution of the Middle Eastern nation of Bahrain, which states that \"[n]o authority shall prevail over the judgement of a judge, and under no circumstances may the course of justice be interfered with.\" Further, \"[i]t is in everyone's interest to foster the rule-of-law evolution.\" O'Connor proposed that such ideas be taught in American law schools, high schools and universities. Critics contend that such thinking is contrary to the U.S. Constitution and establishes a rule of man, rather than law. In her retirement, she has continued to speak and organize conferences on the issue of judicial independence.
