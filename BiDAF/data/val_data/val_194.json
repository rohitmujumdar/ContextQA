{"paragraphs": [{"context": "On January 13, 2008, Zenyatta stopped the tele-timer in 1:40.61 and broke the stakes record in the 1-1/16-mi Grade 2 El Encino Stakes at Santa Anita. She was ridden by David Flores and won by 3/4 of a length carrying 116 lb. Zenyatta traveled to Oaklawn Park on April 5, 2008, for her first start on dirt and her first Grade 1 attempt. There she defeated the 2007 Older Female champion, Ginger Punch, and won the Apple Blossom Handicap for her first Grade 1 victory. She won by 4 1/2  lengths and completed the 1 1/16 miles in 1:42.64. She was ridden by Mike Smith for the first time, a partnership that continued for the last 17 races of her career. She paid $5.60 to win, $3.60 to place, and $2.20 to show. Zenyatta went on to win the Grade 2 Milady Handicap and the Grade 1 Vanity Handicap at Hollywood Park. She then set a track record of 1:41.48 for 1 1/16 miles and won the Grade 2 Clement L. Hirsch at Del Mar. On September 27, 2008, Zenyatta won the Grade 1 Lady's Secret Stakes at Santa Anita Park. She clocked negative splits throughout the race, running each quarter faster than the one before it. Her splits were :24 4/5, :23 4/5, :23 1/5, :22 3/5, and a final sixteenth in :06 flat.
