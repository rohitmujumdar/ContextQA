{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Jan and Dean's career together ended with Jan Berry's death on March 26, 2004, after he suffered a seizure eight days before his 63rd birthday. Berry was an organ donor, and his body was cremated. On April 18, 2004, a \"Celebration of Life\" was held in Berry's memory at the Roxy Theatre on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, California. Attendees included Torrence, Lou Adler, Jill Gibson, and Nancy Sinatra, along with many family members, friends, and musicians associated with Jan and Dean and the Beach Boys, including the original members of Papa Doo Run Run. In February 2010, the Jan & Dean album Carnival of Sound was released on the Rhino Handmade label. The album cover was designed by Torrence. Along with the CD, there was a limited edition (1500 copies), which included a 10-track LP. The album was released in Europe in April 2010 in its original US form. In 2012, Torrence reunited with Bruce Davison, who portrayed him in the 1978 film Deadman's Curve to perform with the Bamboo Trading Company on their From Kitty Hawk To Surf City album. The songs were \"Shrewd Awakening\" and \"Tonga Hut\", which was featured on the film Return of the Killer Shrews, a sequel to the 1959 film The Killer Shrews and also \"Tweet (Don't Talk Anymore)\", \"Drinkin' In the Sunshine\", and \"Star Of The Beach\". The album also feature Dean's two daughters, Jillian and Katie Torrence. Torrence and his two daughters were featured in the music video of \"Shrewd Awakening\". Torrence now tours occasionally with the Surf City All-Stars. He serves as a spokesman for the City of Huntington Beach, California, which, thanks in part to his efforts, is nationally recognized as \"Surf City USA.\" Dean's website, features--among other things--rare images, a complete Jan & Dean discography, a biography, and a timeline of his career with cohort Jan Berry. He currently resides in Huntington Beach, California, with his wife and two daughters.

Their other charting top 10 singles were \"Drag City\" (1963), \"The Little Old Lady from Pasadena\" (1964), and \"Dead Man's Curve\" (1964); the last was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008.", "title": "Jan and Dean"}
