{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Kinard was selected by the Brooklyn Dodgers in the third round (18th overall pick) of the 1938 NFL Draft. He made $1,974 as a rookie, a sum that Kinard recalled \"was a lot of money back then.\" Even in 1938, Kinard was small for a lineman at 210 pounds, but he noted: \"I had enough ability to offset my size. And my speed was a lot better than any of the linemen.\" He was a two-way player known for making \"crushing blocks\" on offense and as a \"smothering, dominant tackler\" who made \"stops all over the field\" on defense. Joe Stydahar, a fellow Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee who played against Kinard, recalled: \"The Brooklyn team used to have plays designed just for the blocking of Kinard. They'd get Frank out there against a defender and he'd just mow them down.\" Kinard spent seven seasons with the Dodgers from 1938 to 1944 and developed a reputation as one of the toughest and most durable players in the NFL. According to his Pro Football Hall of Fame biography, he \"rarely needed a rest and near-60-minute performances were the rule, rather than the exception.\" He appeared as a starter at tackle in every game for the Dodgers in 1938, 1939, 1941, 1942, 1943, and 1944. During his seven years in the NFL, he missed only two games, those coming in the 1940 season after an opposing player stepped on his hand and gangrene threatened amputation of the hand. Kinard was also a regular on the NFL's annual All-Pro teams receiving first-team recognition from one or more selectors in six of his seven years in the NFL: in 1938 from the Pro Football Writers Association (PFWA); in 1940 from the NFL, Associated Press (AP), United Press (UP), and International News Service (INS); in 1941 from the NFL and UP; in 1942 from the INS; and in 1943 and 1944 from the AP. He received second-team All-Pro honors in 1939 from the NFL, UP, and PFWA. Although used principally as a tackle, Kinard scored 42 points for the Yankees, scoring touchdowns on a reception in 1943 and a fumble recovery in 1941, kicking a field goal in 1943, and converting 27 of 30 extra point kicks. With Jock Sutherland as head coach, the Dodgers ranked among the top teams in the NFL, finishing second in the NFL East with records of 8-3 in 1940 and 7-4 in 1941. Sutherland left the team in 1942, and the club dropped to 2-8 in 1943 and 0-10 in 1944.
