{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Winans recorded his second album Hurt No More in 2001, 2002, and 2003 in between working with other artists. The album is based on stories of love and betrayal. The first single \"I Don't Wanna Know\" was based on a sample of the Fugees' 1996 hit single \"Ready or Not\", which itself was based on a slowed-down sample of the instrumental track \"Boadicea\" by Enya from her 1987 self-titled album. Enya and her representatives became angry when Winans did not seek her approval for the sample, as he was unaware that the Fugees sample he had used had itself been a sample. So, a compromise was reached to credit the single as \"Mario Winans featuring P. Diddy and Enya\". The song features a rap by P. Diddy. The song was released as the single in early 2004 and became a worldwide hit, reaching number 1 in Germany and the United Kingdom and on the rhythmic top 40 radio chart in the United States; to number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the US R&B/Hip-Hop singles chart; and to number 3 on both the Australian and Norwegian singles charts. It also reached the top ten on a composite European singles chart. Hurt No More was released on April 20, 2004 in the US and by early June 2004 had reached number 1 on the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, number 2 on the Billboard 200, and number 3 on the UK Albums Chart. The album's second single, \"Never Really Was\", used a sample of the orchestrated beginning of Madonna's 1986 hit, \"Papa Don't Preach\", as its background music. However, the song failed to chart in America. A remix version was released as a single featuring rapper Lil Flip. The song \"This Is the Thanks I Get\" was stated to be the album's third and final single but no official release was set. The song went on to peak on the Billboard Bubbling Under R&B chart at number 12.
