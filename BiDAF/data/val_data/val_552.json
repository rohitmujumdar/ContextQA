{"paragraphs": [{"context": "On 18 September 1877 in Benalla, Kelly, while drunk, was arrested for riding over a footpath and locked-up for the night. The next day, while he was escorted by four policemen, he absconded and ran, taking refuge in a shoemaker's shop. The police and the shop owner tried to handcuff him but failed. During the struggle Kelly's trousers were ripped off. Trying to get Kelly to submit and taking advantage of his torn trousers, the Irish-born Constable Thomas Lonigan, whom Kelly later murdered at Stringybark Creek, \"black-balled\" him (grabbed and squeezed his testicles). During the struggle, a miller walked in, and on seeing the behaviour of the police said \"You should be ashamed of yourselves\". He then tried to pacify the situation and induced Kelly to put on the handcuffs. Kelly was charged with being drunk and assaulting police, and fined L3 1s, which included damage to the uniforms. Kelly said about the incident, \"It was in the course of this attempted arrest Fitzpatrick endeavoured to catch hold of me by the foot, and in the struggle he tore the sole and heel of my boot clean off. With one well-directed blow, I sent him sprawling against the wall, and the staggering blow I then gave him partly accounts to me for his subsequent conduct towards my family and myself\". It is reported that in the aftermath, Kelly ominously foreshadowed the crime that would eventually sentence him to death, and told Lonigan, \"Well, Lonigan, I never shot a man yet. But if ever I do, so help me God, you'll be the first\".
