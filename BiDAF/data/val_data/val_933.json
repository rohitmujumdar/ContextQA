{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Upon returning to Japan, on January 27 Sugizo released two digital singles, \"Fatima\" and \"Do-Funk Dance\", another on February 24 entitled \"Prana\", which also topped the iTunes electronic charts, and one more on March 31 named \"Dear Spiritual Life\". Sugizo was the music director and composer of the soundtrack for jidaigeki theatre stage play Nemuri Kyoshiro Buraihikae, featuring Gackt in the main role, which ran for 120 performances across Japan. In April he performed at the Nagisa Music Festival. On July 8, Sugizo announced that he would help his friend Mick Karn, who was diagnosed with cancer, by remixing his song \"Missing\". The song was renamed \"Missing Link\" and was available for download in return for a donation on Mick's official website to help fund the expensive medical treatment. Mick Karn died on January 4, 2011. On August 29, he held a fan club only event called \"Soul's Mate Day IV\". The show featured an acoustic set which was given the name \"Soul's Mate Quintet\". On August 31, he and Luna Sea attended a press conference in Hong Kong, where they announced that they would be touring worldwide after 10 years of inactivity. From November 5 to 8, Sugizo teamed up with drummers Budgie, Leonard Eto and Mabi, and multi-instrumentalist Knox Chandler in Hong Kong, to participate in a project called \"The Butterfly Effect: East-West Percussive Parade\", as part of the \"New Vision Arts Festival\". On April 13, 2011, Sugizo released two singles, \"No More Nukes Play the Guitar\" and \"The Edge\". On June 29, he released the single \"Miranda\", followed by \"Neo Cosmoscape\" on July 27, which was remixed by System 7, \"Enola Gay\" on August 15, and \"Pray for Mother Earth\" on September 9, a song he wrote with Toshinori Kondo for Earth Day 2006. On December 14, Sugizo released two albums, Flower of Life and Tree of Life. The first is completely instrumental with psychedelic and electronica songs, while the second includes remixed songs and those done in collaboration with other artists. In December, a four-date tour titled \"Stairway to the Flower of Life\" was held, with a concert in Taipei and Hong Kong.
