{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In February 2005, Bagwell and Biggio were jointly inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame. Shortly after the 2005 season began, the chronic arthritic condition in his shoulder that had begun in 2001 finally sidelined him, rendering him inactive for three-quarters of the season. The former Gold Glove winner was now subjugated into a defensive liability with severely restricted throwing ability, forcing him to \"push\" the ball instead of throwing it. Teams began taking advantage of his defensive increased weakness. Once possessing great ability to throw out the lead runner at third base ahead on bunt plays, Bagwell found it difficult to practice with the other infielders between innings. Concurrently, Bagwell's offensive production suffered, and pressure mounted on Astros management to bench the perennial All-Star; the club had started the season with a 15-30 won-loss record. He hit his last major league home run against Maddux, now pitching for Chicago, on April 29, tying him for the most against any pitcher with seven. Bagwell continued to play through the pain until, after going 0-for-5 in a loss to the Pirates on May 4, it became so unbearable that he asked manager Phil Garner to remove him from the lineup the following day. He had hit just .250 with three home runs in 88 at bats. The Astros placed him on the disabled list a few days later and shoulder surgery followed. The Astros dramatically improved after the poor start to finish 74-43 over their final 117 games and capture the NL wild card. Rendered unable to throw from the surgery, the club activated Bagwell in September as a pinch hitter, and he played a symbolic role in the successful drive to capture their first-ever National League pennant and World Series appearance. Moreover, the Astros secured the pennant against their division rival St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS, reversing the outcome from the year prior against the same club. After having played 4,714 games and their entire major league careers together in Houston, Bagwell and Biggio appeared in their first World Series in 2005. Bagwell was the Astros' designated hitter in the first two games against the White Sox at U.S. Cellular Field, and a pinch hitter in the two games played in Houston at Minute Maid Park. His last official major league plate appearance was in the seventh inning of Game 4, when he pinch hit for pitcher Brandon Backe and grounded out. The White Sox won this contest to sweep the Astros and secure the championship. With contributions of only a partially healthy Bagwell, the White Sox outscored the Astros by a combined six runs, the lowest scoring differential in World Series history. Together with Biggio, Bagwell received Baseball America's Lifetime Achievement Award after the 2005 season.
