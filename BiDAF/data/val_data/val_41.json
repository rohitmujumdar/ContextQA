{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Azaria's friends refer to him as \"the freakish mimic\" due to his ability to copy almost anyone's voice, instantly after he has heard it. As a child he believed that everyone could do this, but later realized that it was not a common talent. Azaria can \"remember every voice I hear, famous or otherwise ... they kind of remain in the memory banks, so I'm ready to trot them out.\" Azaria was glad to have found the \"ultimate outlet\" for this skill, in The Simpsons. He \"didn't realize it [when he joined the show], but it became like a lab for a character actor. I had to do so many voices.\" In the early 2000s, Azaria felt he had reached the maximum number of voices he was capable of: \"For the first 10 years of The Simpsons, I would develop a bunch of voices. And then ... I hit a point when I was tapped out. Every noise I can make, I have made. Even characters like Gargamel, I've done. Even if it was only two or three lines, at some point I've done something similar on The Simpsons, at least somewhere along the line.\" For many of Azaria's characters, much of their humor is derived from a \"funny voice\", such as The Birdcage and Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian. He stated that \"being funny with a funny voice is more my comfort zone, a broader character that I try to humanize, a kind of silly or wacky persona that I try to fill in,\" although he finds it \"much easier to be someone much closer to myself\", as it requires \"less energy ... than playing characters that are so out there and high strung\". The Simpsons creator Matt Groening has stated that Azaria possesses the ability to turn unfunny lines into some of the best in an episode, while former writer Jay Kogen stated: \"Just when I think I know [Azaria's] bag of tricks, he's always got a new thing he does to surprise me.\" Throughout the run of The Simpsons, Azaria has had to sing in character several times, a task which he describes as easier than singing normally. The Smurfs writer David N. Weiss says Azaria \"has a beautiful treasure trove of talent\", and \"became what you wished you were writing\". Playwright Jenelle Riley wrote in 2005 that Azaria was \"by far\" her favorite actor, praising his \"versatility\" and \"tendency to take small roles that would normally fade into the background and to consistently create characters people care about\", noting his roles in Shattered Glass, Mystery, Alaska and especially DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story.
