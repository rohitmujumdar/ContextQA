{"paragraphs": [{"context": "With two female members, the New Journeymen needed a new name. According to Doherty, Elliot had the inspiration for the band's new name; as written on his website: We're all just lying around vegging out watching TV and discussing names for the group. The New Journeymen was not a handle that was going to hang on this outfit. John was pushing for the Magic Cyrcle. Eech, but none of us could come up with anything better, then we switch the channel and, hey, it's the Hells Angels on the Carson show... And the first thing we hear is: \"Now hold on there, Hoss. Some people call our women cheap, but we just call them our Mamas.\" Cass jumped up: \"Yeah! I want to be a Mama.\" And Michelle is going: \"We're the Mamas! We're the Mamas!\" OK. I look at John. He's looking at me going: \"The Papas?\" Problem solved. A toast! To the Mamas and the Papas. Well, after many, many toasts, Cass and John are passed out.\" Doherty also said that the occasion marked the beginning of his affair with Michelle Phillips. Elliot was in love with Doherty and was displeased when he told her of the affair. Doherty has said that Elliot once proposed to him, but that he was so stoned at the time that he could not even respond. Elliot was known for her sense of humor and optimism, and was considered by some to be the most charismatic member of the group. Her powerful, distinctive voice was a major factor in their success. She is best remembered for her vocals on the group's hits \"California Dreamin'\", \"Monday, Monday\", \"Words of Love\", and the solo \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\", which the group recorded in 1968 after learning about the death of Fabian Andre, one of the men who co-wrote it, whom Michelle Phillips had met years earlier. Elliot's version is noteworthy for its contemplative pace, whereas almost all earlier recordings of \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" (including one by Nat King Cole and another by Ozzie Nelson) had been up-tempo versions--the song having been written in 1931 as a dance tune. The Mamas & the Papas continued to record to meet the terms of their record contract. Their final album was released in 1971.
