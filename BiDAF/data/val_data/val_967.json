His song \"Me llaman Calle\", written for the 2005 Spanish film Princesas, earned that film a Goya nomination for Best Original Song. It has been released in 2007's La Radiolina. Vocals from the song are included in the Go Lem System song \"Calle Go Lem\". Time magazine named \"Me Llaman Calle\" one of The 10 Best Songs of 2007, ranking it at No. 8. Writer Josh Tyrangiel observed, Chao's warm singing over Jose Manuel Gamboa and Carlos Herrero's leaping Flamenco counter melody creates a direct emotional line to the core of this mid-tempo ballad. With its easy melody and universal rhythm Me Llaman Calle walks proudly in the shadow of Bob Marley, the last guy who made world music this disarmingly simple. Manu Chao was featured on the album True Love by Toots and the Maytals, which won the Grammy Award in 2004 for Best Reggae Album, and showcased many notable musicians including Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Trey Anastasio, Gwen Stefani / No Doubt, Ben Harper, Bonnie Raitt, The Roots, Ryan Adams, Keith Richards, Toots Hibbert, Paul Douglas, Jackie Jackson, Ken Boothe, and The Skatalites. His song \"La Vida Tombola\" was featured in the documentary film Maradona by Serbian filmmaker Emir Kusturica. The song \"La Trampa\", recorded with Tonino Carotone for the compilation album Fuerza! was used as the theme song for the short-lived improvisational comedy Drew Carey's Green Screen Show. The songs \"Bongo Bong\" and \"Je ne t'aime plus\", which appear back-to-back on Clandestino, were covered by British singers Robbie Williams and Lily Allen, who recorded them as a single track, \"Bongo Bong and Je Ne T'aime Plus\" and released it as a single from the album Rudebox.
