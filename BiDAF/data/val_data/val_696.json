{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Growing up in Harlem, Baldwin faced many obstacles, one of which was his education. \"I knew I was black, of course, but I also knew I was smart. I didn't know how I would use my mind, or even if I could, but that was the only thing I had to use,\" he said. Baldwin attended P.S. 24 on 128th Street, between Fifth and Madison Avenues in Harlem, where he wrote the school song which was used until the school closed. As recounted in \"Notes of a Native Son,\" when he was nine and a half years old, Baldwin wrote a play that was directed by a teacher at his school. Seeing his talent and potential, she offered to take him to \"real\" plays. This caused some backlash from Baldwin's stepfather because the teacher was white. His uncertainty was ultimately overruled by Baldwin's mother who said that \"it would not be very nice to let such a kind woman make the trip for nothing.\" When his teacher came to pick him up, Baldwin noticed that his stepfather was filled with disgust. Baldwin later realized that this encounter was an \"unprecedented and frightening\" situation for his parents: \"It was clear, during the brief interview in our living room, that my father was agreeing very much against his will and that he would have refused permission if he had dared. The fact that he did not dare caused me to despise him: I had no way of knowing that he was facing in that living room a wholly unprecedented and frightening situation.\" His middle school years were spent at Frederick Douglass Junior High where he was influenced by poet Countee Cullen, a leading figure in the Harlem Renaissance, and was encouraged by his math teacher to serve as editor of the school newspaper, The Douglass Pilot. (Directly preceding him at Frederick Douglass were Brock Peters, the future actor, and Bud Powell, the future jazz pianist.) Also in \"Notes of a Native Son,\" Baldwin gives advice to little James to \"Take no one's word for anything, including mine--but trust your experience.\" He then went on to DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx's Bedford Park section. There, along with Richard Avedon, Baldwin worked on the school magazine as literary editor but disliked school because of the constant racial slurs.
