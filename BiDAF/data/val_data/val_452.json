{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Charles Edward Greene was born September 24, 1946, in Temple, Texas. He played high school football at Dunbar High School in Temple. Despite Greene's talents, the Dunbar Panthers had a mediocre record, and he was not heavily recruited by colleges. His options were limited further due to segregation of the Southwest Conference. He was eventually offered a scholarship to play college football at North Texas State University (now University of North Texas), where he played on the varsity team from 1966 to 1968. He led the team to a 23-5-1 record during his three seasons. In his 29 games at defensive tackle, North Texas State held the opposition to 2,507 yards gained on 1,276 rushes, a per-carry average of less than two yards. Greene was a three-time All-Missouri Valley Conference selection. In his junior season Greene married Agnes Craft, also a student at North Texas State and the daughter of a Dallas businessman. Tight on money, they were wed at Craft's sister's house in Dallas. Chuck Beatty, Greene's teammate at North Texas and later again in the NFL with the Steelers, served as best man. As a senior, Greene was a consensus pick as a defensive tackle for the 1968 All-America team, earning first-team honors from United Press International (UPI), the Newspaper Enterprise Association, and The Sporting News, among others. His college coach, Rod Rust, said of Greene: \"There are two factors behind Joe's success. First, he has the ability to make the big defensive play and turn the tempo of a game around. Second, he has the speed to be an excellent pursuit player.\" A pro scout said, \"He's tough and mean and comes to hit people. He has good killer instincts. He's mobile and hostile.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "Where was he born?", "answers": [{"text": "Temple, Texas.", "answer_start": 54}, {"text": "Temple, Texas.", "answer_start": 54}, {"text": "Temple, Texas.", "answer_start": 54}, {"text": "Temple, Texas.", "answer_start": 54}, {"text": "Charles Edward Greene was born September 24, 1946, in Temple, Texas.", "answer_start": 0}], "id": "C_ae03fafc4b924bbf895654156aa0f02b_1_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "Charles Edward Greene was born September 24, 1946, in Temple, Texas.", "answer_start": 0}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "Who were his parents?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1705}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1705}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1705}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1705}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1705}], "id": "C_ae03fafc4b924bbf895654156aa0f02b_1_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1705}}, {"followup": "m", "yesno": "x", "question": "Did he have any siblings?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1705}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1705}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1705}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1705}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1705}], "id": "C_ae03fafc4b924bbf895654156aa0f02b_1_q#2", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 1705}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "Where did he go to college?", "answers": [{"text": "North Texas State University (now University of North Texas),", "answer_start": 397}, {"text": "North Texas State University (now University of North Texas", "answer_start": 397}, {"text": "North Texas State University (now University of North Texas", "answer_start": 397}, {"text": "He was eventually offered a scholarship to play college football at North Texas State University (now University of North Texas),", "answer_start": 329}, {"text": "He was eventually offered a scholarship to play college football at North Texas State University (now University of North Texas),", "answer_start": 329}], "id": "C_ae03fafc4b924bbf895654156aa0f02b_1_q#3", "orig_answer": {"text": "He was eventually offered a scholarship to play college football at North Texas State University (now University of North Texas),", "answer_start": 329}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "How did he do at NTSU?", "answers": [{"text": "he played on the varsity team from 1966 to 1968.
