{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Hitchens wrote book-length biographical essays about Thomas Jefferson (Thomas Jefferson: Author of America), Thomas Paine (Thomas Paine's \"Rights of Man\": A Biography) and George Orwell (Why Orwell Matters). He became known for his critiques of public contemporary figures including Mother Teresa, Bill Clinton and Henry Kissinger-- the subjects of three separate full length texts, The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice, No One Left to Lie To: The Triangulations of William Jefferson Clinton, and The Trial of Henry Kissinger. In 2007, while promoting his book God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything, Hitchens described the Christian evangelist Billy Graham as \"a self-conscious fraud\" and \"a disgustingly evil man\". Hitchens claimed that the evangelist, who had recently been hospitalized for intestinal bleeding, made a living by \"going around spouting lies to young people. What a horrible career. I gather it's soon to be over. I certainly hope so.\" In response to the comments, writers Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy published an article in Time Magazine in which, among other things, they refuted Hitchens's suggestion that Graham went into ministry to make money. They argued that during his career Graham 'turn[ed] down million-dollar television and Hollywood offers'. They also pointed out that having established the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association in 1950, Graham drew a straight salary, comparable to that of a senior minister, irrespective of the money raised by his meetings. Other of Hitchens's critiques took the form of opinion pieces or lengthy lectures, including his critiques of Jerry Falwell, George Galloway, Slobodan Milosevic, Mel Gibson, the 14th Dalai Lama, Michael Moore, Daniel Pipes, Ronald Reagan, Jesse Helms, and Cindy Sheehan.
