{"paragraphs": [{"context": "During the 1960s, Ray experimented increasingly with the so-called Nashville sound, singing slow ballads and utilizing lush arrangements of strings and backing singers. Examples include his 1967 rendition of \"Danny Boy\", and \"For the Good Times\" in 1970 which was Price's first country music chart No. 1 hit since \"The Same Old Me\" in 1959. Written by Kris Kristofferson, the song also scored No. 11 on the popular music chart and featured a mellower Price backed by sophisticated musical sounds, quite in contrast to the honky tonk sounds Price had pioneered two decades before. Price had three more No. 1 country music successes during the 1970s: \"I Won't Mention It Again\", \"She's Got To Be A Saint\", and \"You're the Best Thing That Ever Happened To Me\" (the last of which was a pop hit in Canada, and would gain greater fame a year later when Gladys Knight & the Pips covered it). His final top ten hit was \"Diamonds In The Stars\" in early 1982. Price continued to have songs on the country music chart through 1989. Later, he sang gospel music and recorded such songs as \"Amazing Grace\", \"What A Friend We Have In Jesus\", \"Farther Along\" and \"Rock of Ages.\" Ray Price briefly made national news again in 1999 when he was arrested for possession of marijuana. According to Price in a 2008 interview, old friend Willie Nelson--no stranger to marijuana arrests--phoned and told him he'd just earned $5 million in free publicity with the drug bust. In 2009, Price made two performances for the Fox News show Huckabee. The first was with the Cherokee Cowboys and host Mike Huckabee, and he performed \"Crazy Arms\" and \"Heartaches By The Number\". Weeks later he performed with the Cherokee Cowboys and Willie Nelson (again with Huckabee playing bass guitar). This time they performed duets of \"Faded Love\" and \"Crazy.\" Price worked on his last but one album, Last of the Breed, with fellow country music singers Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard. This album was released on March 20, 2007 by the company Lost Highway Records. The two-disc set features 20 country classics as well as a pair of new compositions. The trio toured the U.S. from March 9 until March 25 starting in Arizona and finishing in Illinois. This was Price's third album with Nelson and first album with Haggard. After the tour, Haggard remarked, \"I told Willie when it was over, 'That old man gave us a goddamn singing lesson.' He really did. He just sang so good. He sat there with the mic against his chest. And me and Willie are all over the microphone trying to find it, and he found it.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "What did Ray Price do in the 1960s ?", "answers": [{"text": "During the 1960s, Ray experimented increasingly with the so-called Nashville sound,", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Ray experimented increasingly with the so-called Nashville sound, singing slow ballads and utilizing lush arrangements of strings and backing singers.", "answer_start": 18}, {"text": "Ray experimented increasingly with the so-called Nashville sound, singing slow ballads and utilizing lush arrangements of strings and backing singers.", "answer_start": 18}, {"text": "During the 1960s, Ray experimented increasingly with the so-called Nashville sound, singing slow ballads and utilizing lush arrangements of strings and backing singers.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "experimented increasingly with the so-called Nashville sound, singing slow ballads and utilizing lush arrangements of strings and backing singers.", "answer_start": 22}], "id": "C_4898bbdddc5e4037a7f16010604b689e_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "experimented increasingly with the so-called Nashville sound, singing slow ballads and utilizing lush arrangements of strings and backing singers.", "answer_start": 22}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "x", "question": "Which songs employed the Nashville Sound did Ray Price sing ?", "answers": [{"text": "his 1967 rendition of \"Danny Boy\", and \"For the Good Times\" in 1970", "answer_start": 186}, {"text": "his 1967 rendition of \"Danny Boy\", and \"For the Good Times\" in 1970", "answer_start": 186}, {"text": "Examples include his 1967 rendition of \"Danny Boy\", and \"For the Good Times", "answer_start": 169}, {"text": "his 1967 rendition of \"Danny Boy\", and \"For the Good Times\" in 1970 which was Price's first", "answer_start": 186}], "id": "C_4898bbdddc5e4037a7f16010604b689e_0_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "his 1967 rendition of \"Danny Boy\", and \"For the Good Times\" in 1970 which was Price's first", "answer_start": 186}}, {"followup": "y", "yesno": "y", "question": "Did these songs do well in the charts ?", "answers": [{"text": "\"For the Good Times\" in 1970 which was Price's first country music chart No. 1 hit", "answer_start": 225}, {"text": "\"For the Good Times\" in 1970 which was Price's first country music chart No. 1 hit since \"The Same Old Me\" in 1959.", "answer_start": 225}, {"text": "1970 which was Price's first country music chart No. 1 hit since \"The Same Old Me\"", "answer_start": 249}, {"text": ").
