{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In early 2013, despite the news of the departure of two band members (drummer Shannon Lucas and bassist Bart Williams), plans were announced for an upcoming album release, to be entitled Everblack. Tentative plans estimated its release to be early summer 2013; likely June. On April 10, 2013, the iTunes Store was updated with official release and availability information, including cover art, a full track listing, and an official U.S. release date of June 11, 2013. The album has 10 tracks in total. On the same day, the band's first single from Everblack was made available for purchase and download, titled \"Into The Everblack\". The album itself was then released on June 11 and peaked at No. 32 on the U.S. Billboard 200. On November 28, 2014 (the day after Thanksgiving), The Black Dahlia Murder released a 7\" EP titled Grind 'Em All featuring 3 short grindcore covers of punk rock songs: a cover of \"Ripped Up\" by Left for Dead, of \"Rebel Without a Car\" by Sedition and of \"Populous\" by Gyga. The covers were originally recorded almost 10 years earlier during the era of Miasma. The EP was released as part of Record Store Day's Black Friday event via A389 Recordings (rather than the band's label, Metal Blade Records), made available for purchase on the band's online merchandise store and also streamed in its entirety via Exclaim!. The album art for Grind 'Em All was designed by Szymon Siech. Lead guitarist Ryan Knight confirmed in early 2015 that the band will deliver a seventh studio release that year, followed by extensive touring, and that he is planning to start working on a solo album afterwards. Vocalist Trevor Strnad stated that the band's new album, titled Abysmal, will be \"more raw and natural sounding\" and feature \"more dynamic and developed songs\" than their previous work. \"Vlad, Son of the Dragon\", the first song from the album, was released online on June 24, followed by \"Receipt\" on July 22 and \"Threat Level No. 3\" on August 19. Abysmal was produced by Mark Lewis and Ryan Williams and released worldwide through Metal Blade on September 18. In early February 2016, it was announced that Knight had left the band; Brandon Ellis will replace him as touring lead guitarist.
