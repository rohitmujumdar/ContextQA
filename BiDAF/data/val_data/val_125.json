{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Comaneci began gymnastics in kindergarten with a local team called Flacara (\"The Flame\"), with coaches Duncan and Munteanu. At age 6, she was chosen to attend Bela Karolyi's experimental gymnastics school after Karolyi spotted a friend and her turning cartwheels in a schoolyard. Karolyi was looking for gymnasts he could train from a young age and saw the two girls during recess. When recess ended, the girls ran inside. Karolyi went around the classrooms trying to find them, and eventually spotted Comaneci. (The other girl, Viorica Dumitru, went on to be one of Romania's top ballerinas.) Comaneci was training with Karolyi by the time she was seven years old, in 1968. She was one of the first students at the gymnastics school established in Onesti by Bela and his wife, Marta. Unlike many of the other students at the Karolyi school, Comaneci was able to commute from home for many years because she lived in the town. In 1970, she began competing as a member of her hometown team, and became the youngest gymnast ever to win the Romanian Nationals. In 1971, she participated in her first international competition, a dual junior meet between Romania and Yugoslavia, winning her first all-around title and contributing to the team gold. For the next few years, she competed as a junior in numerous national contests in Romania and dual meets with countries such as Hungary, Italy, and Poland. At the age of 11, in 1973, she won the all-around gold, as well as the vault and uneven bars titles, at the Junior Friendship Tournament (Druzhba), an important international meet for junior gymnasts. Comaneci's first major international success came at the age of 13, when she nearly swept the 1975 European Women's Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Skien, Norway, winning the all-around and gold medals on every event but the floor exercise, in which she placed second. She continued to enjoy success that year, winning the all-around at the \"Champions All\" competition and placing first in the all-around, vault, beam, and bars at the Romanian National Championships. In the pre-Olympic test event in Montreal, Comaneci won the all-around and the balance beam golds, as well as silvers in the vault, floor, and bars behind accomplished Soviet gymnast Nellie Kim, who was one of her greatest rivals over the next five years.
