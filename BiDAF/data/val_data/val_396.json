{"paragraphs": [{"context": "On October 29, 2017, actor Anthony Rapp alleged that Spacey, apparently drunk, made a sexual advance toward him in 1986, when Rapp was 14. Spacey stated through Twitter that he did not remember the encounter, but that he owed Rapp \"the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior\" if he had behaved as asserted. Fifteen others then came forward alleging similar abuse including: journalist Heather Unruh, who alleged that Spacey sexually assaulted her son; Norwegian author and Royal Family member Ari Behn; filmmaker Tony Montana; actor Roberto Cavazos; Richard Dreyfuss's son Harry; and eight people who worked on House of Cards. An anonymous man alleged that he had an extended sexual relationship with Spacey in 1983, when he was 14 and Spacey was 24; the man said that the relationship ended with Spacey attempting to rape him. The Guardian was contacted by \"a number of people\" who worked at the Old Vic, where Spacey was artistic director for 11 years, alleging that he \"groped and behaved in an inappropriate way with young men at the time\". On November 16, the Old Vic confirmed that it had received 20 testimonies of alleged inappropriate behavior by Spacey, with three stating that they contacted the police. In December, Spacey's Usual Suspects costar Gabriel Byrne revealed that production on that film was shut down for two days because Spacey made unwanted sexual advances toward a younger actor. In the midst of the allegations, filming was suspended on the sixth and final season of House of Cards. The show had been due to end in 2018. The season was shortened from 13 episodes to 8, and Spacey was removed from the cast. The Gore Vidal biopic Gore starring Spacey was set to be distributed by Netflix but it was canceled, and Netflix went on to sever all ties with him. Spacey was due to appear in Ridley Scott's biographical film All the Money in the World as industrialist J. Paul Getty; however, his scenes were cut and Christopher Plummer replaced him as Getty in reshoots. The International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences reversed its decision to honor Spacey with the 2017 International Emmy Founders Award. On November 1, Spacey stated that he would be seeking \"evaluation and treatment\" for his behavior. The following day, Variety reported that his publicist Staci Wolfe and talent agency Creative Artists Agency were ending their relationships with him.
