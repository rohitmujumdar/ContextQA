{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Henryk Gorecki was born on December 6, 1933, in the village of Czernica, in present-day Silesian Voivodeship, southwest Poland. The Gorecki family lived modestly, though both parents had a love of music. His father Roman (1904-1991) worked at the goods office of a local railway station, but was an amateur musician, while his mother Otylia (1909-1935), played piano. Otylia died when her son was just two years old, and many of his early works were dedicated to her memory. Henryk developed an interest in music from an early age, though he was discouraged by both his father and new stepmother to the extent that he was not allowed to play his mother's old piano. However, he persisted, and in 1943 was allowed to take violin lessons with Pawel Hajduga; a local amateur musician, instrument maker, sculptor, painter, poet and chlopski filozof (peasant philosopher). In 1937, Gorecki fell while playing in a neighbor's yard and dislocated his hip. The resulting suppurative inflammation was misdiagnosed by a local doctor, and delay in proper treatment led to tubercular complications in the bone. The illness went largely untreated for two years, by which time permanent damage had been sustained. He spent the following twenty months in a hospital in Germany, where he underwent four operations. Gorecki continued to suffer ill health throughout his life and, as a result, said he had \"talked with death often\". In early 1950s he studied in the Szafrankowie Brothers State School of Music in Rybnik. Later studied at the State Higher School of Music in Katowice between 1955 and 1960. He joined the faculty of his alma mater in Katowice in 1965, where he was made a lecturer in 1968, and then rose to provost before resigning in 1979.
