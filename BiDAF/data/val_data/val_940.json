In 1974 he won the Film World magazine Best Singer Award for the song \"Teree Galiyon Mein Na Rakhenge Qadam Aaj Ke Baad\" (Hawas, 1974) composed by Usha Khanna. In 1976, Rafi sang all the songs for Rishi Kapoor in the hit film Laila Majnu. Rafi went on to sing many more songs for Rishi Kapoor in the subsequent hit films, including Hum Kisise Kum Naheen (1977), and Amar Akbar Anthony (1977). In 1977, he won both Filmfare Award and the National Award for the song \"Kya Hua Tera Wada\" from the movie Hum Kisise Kum Naheen, composed by R.D. Burman. He was nominated as the best singer at the Filmfare Awards for the qawwali \"Pardah Hai Pardah\" from Amar Akbar Anthony (1977). Rafi sang for many successful films in the late 1970s and the early 1980s many of whose hit songs were dominating the charts in the late 70s on radio programs such as Vividh Bharati, Binaca Geetmala and Radio Ceylon. Some of these include Bairaag (1976), Dharamveer (1977), Apnapan (1978), Ganga Ki Saugandh (1978), Suhaag (1979), Sargam (1979), Qurbani (1980), Dostana (1980), Karz (1980), The Burning Train (1980), Abdullah (1980), Shaan (1980), Aasha (1980), Aap To Aise Na The (1980), Naseeb (1981) and Zamane Ko Dikhana Hai (1982). In 1978, Rafi gave a performance at the Royal Albert Hall and in 1980 he performed at the Wembley conference centre. From 1970 until his death he toured around the world extensively giving concert performances to packed halls. In December 1979, Rafi recorded six songs for the Hindi remake of Dilip Sen's Bengali superhit Sorry Madam; the film was never completed due to a personal tragedy in Dilip Sen's life. These songs, written by Kafeel Aazar and composed by Chitragupta, were released digitally in December 2009 by the label Silk Road under the title \"The Last Songs\". The physical album was released only in India by Universal.
