{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Barrowman's television career began with several appearances in short-lived prime-time soap operas. Barrowman first starred as Peter Fairchild in Central Park West (1995) a show American film critic Ken Tucker calls \"a tale of ritzy, ditsy New York City careerists--some struggling to make it, others plotting to retain their status and power.\" Television critic David Hiltbrand called Barrowman's character a \"Prince Charming ... a virtuous, hardworking assistant DA who keeps getting distracted by women who swoon in his path.\" Tucker noted Barrowman's character of Peter Fairchild to be \"physically an eye-widening cross between John Kennedy Jr. and Hugh Grant\". The show lasted for two seasons on CBS, from September 1995 to June 1996. Barrowman then appeared as Peter Williams in Titans (2000). According to writer Joanna Bober, in Titans, Barrowman plays a \"ruthless mogul\" who gains \"control of the family's private aviation company (a fleet of 'Titans') from his semi-retired father\" while increasing the profitability of the company amidst a series of soap opera intrigues. Titans was cancelled after airing eleven episodes. Barrowman was also considered for the role of Will in Will and Grace, but the producers reportedly felt he was \"too straight\" and the role eventually went to Eric McCormack instead. Commenting on the decision, Barrowman remarked, \"The sad thing is it's run by gay men and women.\" On 25 March 2008, Barrowman made a guest appearance in episode 22 of the BBC's Hotel Babylon. Entertainment Weekly reported that Barrowman would appear in the 2010 season of Desperate Housewives, \"for a minimum of five episodes, portraying Patrick Logan, the ex-boyfriend at the center of the Angie Bolen (Drea de Matteo) mystery.\" On 23 February 2010 Barrowman announced on The One Show that his contract had been extended to a total of six episodes. Barrowman starred in the ABC drama series pilot Gilded Lillys created and produced by Shonda Rhimes. Since 2012, Barrowman has portrayed Malcolm Merlyn, one of the main antagonists in the CW series Arrow. Barrowman was a recurring cast member for the first two seasons and was promoted to a main cast member beginning with the third season. By July 2016, he signed a deal that allows him to continue being a series regular on Arrow as well as the other superhero shows produced by Greg Berlanti, including The Flash and Legends of Tomorrow. On May 2017, Barrowman announced that he is leaving the Arrowverse television franchise.
