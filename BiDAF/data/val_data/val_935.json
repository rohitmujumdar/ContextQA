{"paragraphs": [{"context": "During a trip to Iceland to perform at the Airwaves Festival, Grant met Birgir Thorarinsson aka Biggi Veira of Icelandic electronic pop group GusGus. The electronic, synthesized dance sounds that Grant was looking for and experimented with in Veira's studio formed much of the backdrop to his second album Pale Green Ghosts, which Veira himself produced. Sinead O'Connor was guest vocalist on three of the tracks, including \"It Doesn't Matter To Him\". Grant was quickly and deeply touched by the people and landscape of Iceland, so much so that he now has a permanent home in Reykjavik. Pale Green Ghosts was released in March 2013, garnering more accolades for Grant. Pale Green Ghosts was Rough Trade Records Album Of The Year, and number 2 in The Guardian's Best Album of 2013. A nomination for Best Solo Artist at the Q Awards followed (with David Bowie and Laura Marling among the other nominees). A nomination for Best International Male Solo Artist at the Brit Awards in 2014 followed, and Attitude named Grant Man of The Year 2014. In 2013 Grant put his linguistic skills to effect by translating Asgeir Trausti album Dyrd i daudathogn. The English version titled In the Silence was released in October of that year. In 2014 he co-wrote No Prejudice the Icelandic entry for the Eurovision Song Contest performed by Pollaponk. In 2014 Grant guested on the 40th anniversary release of Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, covering the song \"Sweet Painted Lady\". Always on the lookout for likely or unlikely collaborations, Grant has been keen to explore his passion for electronic and dance music, guesting on the album The Feast of The Broken Heart, by Hercules & Love Affair and released on Moshi Moshi Records. In the first half of 2014, Grant joined British group Elbow on the North American leg of their tour. In October 2014, accompanied by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra, Grant recorded tracks from his first two albums for a concert on BBC Radio 6 Music arranged by Fiona Brice. This was released as an album: John Grant And The BBC Philharmonic Orchestra: Live In Concert. Grant concluded 2014 with rave reviews following his UK concert hall tour with the Royal Northern Sinfonia. ClashMusic.com wrote that the concert \"could honestly be one of the greatest gigs of all time at London's Royal Festival Hall\".
