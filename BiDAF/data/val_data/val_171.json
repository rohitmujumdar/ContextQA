{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Bob Woodward first describes his source nicknamed Deep Throat in All the President's Men as a \"source in the Executive Branch who had access to information at CRP (the Committee to Re-elect the President, Nixon's 1972 campaign organization), as well as at the White House.\" The book described Deep Throat as an \"incurable gossip\" who was \"in a unique position to observe the Executive Branch\", a man \"whose fight had been worn out in too many battles\". Woodward had known the source before Watergate and had discussed politics and government with him. In 2005, Woodward wrote that he first met Felt at the White House in 1969 or 1970. Woodward was working as an aide to Admiral Thomas Hinman Moorer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and was delivering papers to the White House Situation Room. In his book The Secret Man, Woodward described Felt as a \"tall man with perfectly combed gray hair ... distinguished looking\" with a \"studied air of confidence, even what might be called a command presence\". They stayed in touch and spoke on the telephone several times. When Woodward started working at the Washington Post, he phoned Felt on several occasions to ask for information for articles in the paper. Felt's information, taken on a promise that Woodward would never reveal its origin, was a source for a few stories, notably for an article on May 18, 1972, about Arthur H. Bremer, who shot George C. Wallace. When the Watergate story broke, Woodward called on Felt. The senior manager advised Woodward on June 19 that E. Howard Hunt was involved; the telephone number of his White House office had been listed in the address book of one of the burglars. Initially, Woodward's source was known at the Post as \"My Friend\". Post editor Howard Simons tagged him as \"Deep Throat\", after the widely known porno film Deep Throat. According to Woodward, Simons thought of the term because Felt had been providing information on a deep background basis. When Felt revealed his role in 2005, it was noted that \"My Friend\" has the same initial letters as \"Mark Felt\". Woodward's notes from interviewing Felt were marked \"M.F.\", which Woodward says was \"not very good tradecraft.\" CANNOTANSWER", "qas": [{"followup": "m", "yesno": "x", "question": "who is woodward?", "answers": [{"text": "Woodward wrote that he first met Felt at the White House in 1969 or 1970.", "answer_start": 561}, {"text": "aide to Admiral Thomas Hinman Moorer,", "answer_start": 662}, {"text": "Bob Woodward first describes his source nicknamed Deep Throat in All the President's Men as a \"source in the Executive Branch who had access to information at CRP", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Woodward started working at the Washington Post,", "answer_start": 1076}, {"text": "When Woodward started working at the Washington Post,", "answer_start": 1071}], "id": "C_fc1856715c124f1f93cc043581e3d96a_0_q#0", "orig_answer": {"text": "When Woodward started working at the Washington Post,", "answer_start": 1071}}, {"followup": "m", "yesno": "x", "question": "how did Mark Felt contact Woodward?", "answers": [{"text": "When Woodward started working at the Washington Post, he phoned Felt on several occasions to ask for information", "answer_start": 1071}, {"text": "Woodward wrote that he first met Felt at the White House", "answer_start": 561}, {"text": "In 2005, Woodward wrote that he first met Felt at the White House in 1969 or 1970.", "answer_start": 552}, {"text": "In 2005, Woodward wrote that he first met Felt at the White House in 1969 or 1970.", "answer_start": 552}, {"text": "When the Watergate story broke, Woodward called on Felt.", "answer_start": 1419}], "id": "C_fc1856715c124f1f93cc043581e3d96a_0_q#1", "orig_answer": {"text": "When the Watergate story broke, Woodward called on Felt.", "answer_start": 1419}}, {"followup": "n", "yesno": "x", "question": "what was the watergate story?", "answers": [{"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2179}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2179}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2179}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2179}, {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2179}], "id": "C_fc1856715c124f1f93cc043581e3d96a_0_q#2", "orig_answer": {"text": "CANNOTANSWER", "answer_start": 2179}}, {"followup": "m", "yesno": "x", "question": "What kind of relationship D", "answers": [{"text": "They stayed in touch and spoke on the telephone several times.", "answer_start": 1008}, {"text": "They stayed in touch and spoke on the telephone several times.", "answer_start": 1008}, {"text": "When Woodward started working at the Washington Post, he phoned Felt on several occasions to ask for information for articles in the paper.", "answer_start": 1071}], "id": "C_fc1856715c124f1f93cc043581e3d96a_0_q#3", "orig_answer": {"text": "When Woodward started working at the Washington Post, he phoned Felt on several occasions to ask for information for articles in the paper.", "answer_start": 1071}}], "id": "C_fc1856715c124f1f93cc043581e3d96a_0"}], "section_title": "Contact with Woodward", "background": "William Mark Felt Sr. (August 17, 1913 - December 18, 2008) was a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) special agent and the Bureau's Associate Director, the FBI's second-highest-ranking post, from May 1972 until his retirement from the FBI in June 1973.
