{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Williams first received public recognition for her musical abilities when she won the preliminary talent portion of the Miss America pageant with her rendition of \"Happy Days Are Here Again\" (Williams would later be crowned Miss America 1984). Four years later in 1988, Williams released her debut album, The Right Stuff. The first single, \"The Right Stuff\", found success on the R&B chart, while the second single, \"He's Got the Look\", found similar success on the same chart. The third single, \"Dreamin'\", was a pop hit, becoming Williams' first top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 8, and her first number one single on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The album reached platinum status in the U.S. and earned her a NAACP Image Award and three Grammy Award nominations, including one for Best New Artist. Her second album The Comfort Zone became the biggest success in her music career. The lead single \"Running Back to You\" reached top twenty on the Hot 100, and the top position of Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart on October 5, 1991. Other singles included \"The Comfort Zone\" (#2 R&B), \"Just for Tonight\" (#26 Pop), a cover of The Isley Brothers' \"Work to Do\" (#3 R&B), and the club-only hit \"Freedom Dance (Get Free!).\" The most successful single from the album, as well as her biggest hit to date, is \"Save the Best for Last\". It reached No. 1 in the United States, where it remained for five weeks, as well as No. 1 in Australia, the Netherlands, and Canada, and was in the top 5 in Japan, Ireland and the United Kingdom. The album sold 2.2 million copies in the U.S. at its time of release and has since been certified triple platinum in the United States by the RIAA, gold in Canada by the CRIA, and platinum in the United Kingdom by the BPI. The Comfort Zone earned Williams five Grammy Award nominations. The Sweetest Days, her third album, was released in 1994 to highly-favorable reviews. The album saw Williams branch out and sample other styles of music that included jazz, hip hop, rock, and Latin-themed recordings such as \"Betcha Never\" and \"You Can't Run\", both written and produced by Babyface. Other singles from the album included the adult-contemporary and dance hit \"The Way That You Love\" and the title track. The album was certified platinum in the U.S. by the RIAA and earned her two Grammy Award nominations. Other releases include two Christmas albums, Star Bright in 1996, and Silver & Gold in 2004; Next in 1997, and Everlasting Love in 2005, along with a greatest-hits compilation released in 1998, and a host of other compilations released over the years. Notable chart performances from subsequent albums, motion picture and television soundtracks have included the songs \"Love Is\", which was a duet with Brian McKnight, the Golden Globe- and Academy Award-winning \"Colors of the Wind\", \"Where Do We Go from Here?\", and \"Oh How the Years Go By\".
