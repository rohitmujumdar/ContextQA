{"paragraphs": [{"context": "For the next few years, the group was in a seemingly constant state of flux. Adding Dakar to the permanent line-up, the group recorded \"The Boiler\" with Dakar on vocals, Dammers on keyboard, Bradbury on drums, John Shipley from the Swinging Cats on guitar, Cuthell on brass and Nicky Summers on bass. The single was credited to \"Rhoda with the Special AKA\". The controversial track described an incident of date rape, and its frank and harrowing depiction of the matter meant that airplay was severely limited. Nevertheless, it managed to reach No. 35 on the UK charts, and American writer Dave Marsh later identified \"The Boiler\" as one of the 1,001 best \"rock and soul\" singles of all time in his book The Heart of Rock & Soul. After going on tour with Rodriguez, the band (without Dakar, and as \"Rico and the Special AKA\") also recorded the non-charting (and non-album) single \"Jungle Music\". The line-up for the single was Rodriguez (vocal, trombone), Cuthell (cornets), Dammers (keyboards), Bradbury (drums), Shipley (guitar), returning bassist Panter, and new additions Satch Dickson and Groco (percussion) and Anthony Wymshurst (guitar). Rodriguez and the three newcomers were all dropped for the next single, \"War Crimes\", which brought back Dakar and added new co-vocalists Edgio Newton and Stan Campbell, as well as violinist Nick Parker. Follow-up single \"Racist Friend\" was a minor hit (UK No. 60), with the band establishing themselves as a septet: Dakar, Newton, Campbell, Bradbury, Cuthell, Dammers and Shipley. The new line-up (still known as the Special AKA) finally issued a new full-length album In the Studio in 1984. Officially, the band was now a sextet: Dakar, Campbell, Bradbury, Dammers, Shipley and new bassist Gary McManus. Cuthell, Newton, Panter and Radiation all appeared on the album as guests; as did saxophonist Nigel Reeve, and Claudia Fontaine and Caron Wheeler of the vocal trio Afrodiziak. Both critically and commercially, In The Studio was less successful than previous efforts, although the 1984 single \"Free Nelson Mandela\" was a No. 9 UK hit. The latter contributed to making Mandela's imprisonment a cause celebre in the UK, and became popular with anti-apartheid activists in South Africa. Dammers then dissolved the band and pursued political activism.
