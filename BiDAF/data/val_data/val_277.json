{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 1995 Converge released their first compilation album, Caring and Killing. The album featured tracks from the band's early work from the years 1991 to 1994. The album was originally released as a European exclusive through Lost & Found Records. However, Converge became dissatisfied with the way the label was handling the release and over charging fans for their hard to find older songs. The album was re-released through Hydra Head Records on November 17, 1997 in America to \"make an overpriced release obsolete\". In 1996 Converge released a four-song EP, Petitioning the Empty Sky. The EP was released through Ferret Music, it was one of the earliest releases through the at the time newly formed label. Later that same year the record was re-released with four new tracks added to it. Two years later, the record was reissued through Converge's new label Equal Vision Records on January 20, 1998 this version contained the previous eight tracks as well as three newly added live tracks, which were recorded during a radio broadcast. Due to the addition of the new tracks fans and sources consider this to be Converge's second studio album, while the band considers this a compilation album because the album is a collection of songs recorded at different times. In early 1997 the band's original bassist, Feinburg, left the band and was replaced with Stephen Brodsky. Also in 1997, the band signed to Equal Vision Records. On December 22, 1997 recording for the band's third studio album When Forever Comes Crashing began at Ballou's GodCity Studio and finished on January 3, 1998. On April 14, 1998 Converge released When Forever Comes Crashing through Equal Vision. In 1998, Brodsky left the band and was replaced by Newton, who initially joined the band as a part-time member while he was still active in another band, Jesuit. Jesuit later disbanded in 1999, allowing Newton to make Converge his main focus. In early 1999, the band's original drummer Bellorado left the band and was quickly replaced with John DiGiorgio, who also left the band in the same year. Koller joined Converge in late 1999, replacing DiGiorgio. Ballou selected Koller to temporarily fill-in while Converge searched for a more permanent replacement for Bellorado, as he was familiar with his work in previous bands, Force Fed Glass and Blue/Green Heart, a band that Ballou and Koller played in together. After working well with the band during some local shows in Boston, Converge made him an official member. Newton and Koller remain in the band to this day. In mid-2000 Converge self-released a three track demo record titled Jane Doe Demos, the demo was released on tour and were limited to 100 copies. The demo contained unreleased demo versions of \"Bitter & Then Some\" and \"Thaw\" from their at the time upcoming album Jane Doe. Converge entered the studio to begin recording in the summer of 2001. On September 4, 2001 Converge released their fourth studio album Jane Doe. It was met with immediate critical acclaim, with critics praising its poetic lyrics, dynamic range, ferocity and production. The album was also a commercial success in comparison to Converge's previous outings, and both the band and the album have developed a cult following since its release. It is the band's first studio album to feature Newton and Koller, and the last to feature Dalbec, who was asked to leave the band due to his devotion to his at the time side-project Bane. Converge's first tour in support of Jane Doe was in September, 2001 with Drowningman and Playing Enemy, however Drowningman later dropped out of the tour to work on a new album. In 2002 a music video was released for the track/tracks \"Concubine/Fault and Fracture\" from the album Jane Doe; the music video was directed by Zach Merck. On January 28, 2003 Converge released their second compilation album, Unloved and Weeded Out. The album was originally released as a three track EP in 1995. The 2003 album version contains all three tracks from the 1995 EP but in total features 14 tracks, some of which were previously released rarities while others were previously unreleased. On February 25, 2003 Converge released their first official DVD, The Long Road Home. The DVD is modeled after band home videos such as Metallica's Cliff Em' All release. Deathwish Inc describes the DVD as a \"two disc collection that is as energetic and exciting as the moments the release captures\". The DVD also comes with a bonus disk that included three full live sets from the band. In early 2004 the band announced that they were signing to Epitaph Records, having previously been signed to Equal Vision. When asked about the switch to Epitaph, Bannon stated \"We are confident as artists and genuinely happy about the move. We are part of a diverse, quality roster with Epitaph, rich in both history and integrity. We've struggled for years looking for a supportive label to call home and after a decade we have found it.\" Converge began writing for You Fail Me after they recorded Jane Doe; they wrote on the road during sound checks of shows. Converge entered the studio to begin recording in March 2004 mainly at GodCity Studio. On September 20, 2004 Converge released their fifth studio album You Fail Me. It was the band's first to chart commercially, reaching number 171 on the Billboard 200. On February 14, 2005 a music video was released for the track \"Eagles Become Vultures\" from the album You Fail Me, the music video was directed by Zach Merck. Converge's first tour in support of You Fail Me started in September 2004 with Cave In and Between the Buried and Me. In 2005 Equal Vision reissued Petitioning the Empty Sky and When Forever Comes Crashing. These reissues gave the albums one new bonus track each; Petitioning the Empty Sky received an alternate version of the song \"Love as Arson\" and When Forever Comes Crashing received a demo version of the song \"Bitter and Then Some\". These reissues also came with new album artwork by Aaron Turner of Isis. Ballou stated in an interview he wanted to remix and remaster the albums because the quality of Converge's recordings had improved so much that the original recordings of these two albums were \"becoming distracting\". These reissues became the standard versions of these albums.
