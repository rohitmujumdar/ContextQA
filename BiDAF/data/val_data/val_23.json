{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Day for Night was then released in 1994, producing six singles, including \"Nautical Disaster\" and \"Grace, Too\". Trouble at the Henhouse followed in 1996, producing five singles, including \"Ahead by a Century\" and \"Butts Wigglin\", which would also appear on the soundtrack to the Kids in the Hall movie Brain Candy. Live Between Us, was recorded on the subsequent tour at Cobo Arena in Detroit, Michigan. The band developed a unique sound and ethos, leaving behind its earlier blues influence. Downie's vocal style changed while the band experimented with song structures and chord progressions. Songs explored the themes of Canadian geography and history, water and land, all motifs that became heavily associated with the Hip. While Fully Completely began an exploration of deeper themes, many critics consider Day for Night to be the Hip's artistry most fully realized. The sound here is typically called \"enigmatic\" and \"dark\", while critic MacKenzie Wilson praises \"the poignancy of Downie's minimalism.\" On the follow-up tour for this album, the band made its only appearance on Saturday Night Live, thanks in large part to the finagling of fellow Canadian and Kingston-area resident Dan Aykroyd. The band's performance on the show was one of their highest profile media appearances in the United States. In July 1996, the Hip headlined Edenfest. The three-day concert took place at Mosport Park, in Bowmanville, Ontario, Canada, just a few months after the LP Trouble at the Henhouse was released. The concert sold over 70,000 tickets total and was attended by an estimated 20,000 additional people who gained access to the concert site after the outside security broke down.
