{"paragraphs": [{"context": "In 1984, Bohlen cited the hit single \"Precious Little Diamond\" (by Fox the Fox), as his inspiration for using falsetto choruses. The studio vocal line up of Rolf Kohler, Michael Scholz, Detlef Wiedeke and (on early albums) Birger Corleis, in addition to Bohlen and Anders, produced the high choruses characteristic of Modern Talking. Kohler, Scholz and Wiedeke later went on to work with Bohlen in Blue System, before joining with songwriter Thomas Widrat to form Systems in Blue. Kohler, Scholz and Wiedeke were never credited on the Modern Talking albums, and eventually went to court over the matter. They received an out of court settlement and Bohlen published a sleeve note for his next release (Obsession, by Blue System), acknowledging the trio's contribution. Further influences include German-language schlager music, disco pop (the Bee Gees) and romantic English-language songs of Italian and French origin, like Gazebo's \"I Like Chopin\". After the 1998 reunion, Bohlen produced Eurodance as well as American-style MOR ballads. Global sales of Modern Talking, after the duo's second and final break-up in 2003, had reached 120 million singles and albums combined, making them the biggest-selling German music act in history. Dieter Bohlen also composed for other artists while still in Modern Talking, such as for Chris Norman and Smokie, whose song \"Midnight Lady\" (1986) remains Bohlen's most popular composition. He also composed a large number of tracks for C. C. Catch, using an accelerated, less-romantic sound. Some English Bohlen songs such as \"You're My Heart, You're My Soul\" were also recorded with German lyrics by Mary Roos, using the same playback tracks. When Modern Talking split up in 1987, a number of tracks written for the last album were re-arranged and then transferred onto Bohlen's first solo album by Blue System. Modern Talking's sixth album was released about the same time as the first single from Blue System, \"Sorry Little Sarah\", where Bohlen competed on the charts against Modern Talking's \"In 100 Years\" hit song.
